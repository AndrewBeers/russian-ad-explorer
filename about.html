      <h1>The Russian Ad Explorer</h1>
      <h3>Background</h3>
      On May 10, 2018, Democrats on the United States House Intelligence Committee released 3500+ ads created by the Internet Research Agency between 2015 and 2017. The Internet Research Agency is believed to have created ads to influence the outcome of the 2016 United States presidential election, and more broadly influence the Americans' political views. Many journalists and coders have already published visualizations and articles on this work -- for a more in-depth analysis, you can read some of their work: <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/2018/05/11/what-we-found-facebook-ads-russians-accused-election-meddling/602319002/">USA Today</a>, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/05/14/technology/facebook-ads-congress.html">NYTimes</a>, <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2018/05/10/here-are-the-3400-facebook-ads-purchased-by-russias-online-trolls-during-the-2016-election/?utm_term=.bcf68aad1b78">Washington Post</a>, <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/house-democrats-release-3500-russia-linked-facebook-ads/">Wired</a>.
      <br />
      <h3>Summary</h3>
      While I have not spent too much time exploring at these ads yet, there are a few interesting trends that I noticed immediately. Contrary to my own expectations, a significant portion if not a majority of these ads are aimed at people of color, LGBTQ+, and explicitly progressive audiences. Many of these ads redirected to seemingly-progressive groups that nontheless encouraged visitors to vote for Trump, or not to vote for Hillary. One of the most prominent examples is Williams & Kalvin, two Black bloggers that were paid by a Russian group to persuade viewers not to vote for Hillary (<a herf="">link</a>). IRA ads would use progressive issues, such as racist police violence against Black people, to draw viewers to Williams & Kalvin.
      <br /><br />
      It is also worth noting that some ad campaigns were explicitly non-political, such as the "Memeopolis" campaign that marketed solely on memes. Other content included ads that reference popular movies or had pictures of women without a further political message, and ads that used offers for a music player called "facemusic" that actually redirected to an anti-immigration page.
      <br /><br />
      Ads generated appealing to conservative viewers featured ideas more violent and retrograde than were often found in mainstream media. One ad for "Stop A.I.", a violently anti-immigrant Facebook page, featured a racist caricature of a Mexican immigrant on a bugs body, with the subtitle "It's time to get rid of parasites". Other ads used Confederate imagery, or equated Hillary with Satan and talked of an army of Jesus.
      <br /><br />
      Many other discoveries can be made with the explorer. Sorting by cost efficiency shows that many of the most effective ads marketed pictures of attractive and/or nude women. Searching "bernie" shows that the IRA was purchasing pro-Bernie ads both before and after the nomination of Hillary Clinton in the Democratic Primary. Searching or sorting by "Veteran" will show a large amount of ads meant to sway veterans to Trump's side, while looking at the "Patriotism" category will show ads from an entire campaign built around American patriotism. I am sure there are many other ads to discover -- send a note, or share an ad, if you find something interesting.

      <h3>Data Extraction and Public Access</h3>

      Democrats on the United States House Intelligence committee released the original dataset at this link: <a href="https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/facebook-ads/social-media-advertisements.htm">https://democrats-intelligence.house.gov/facebook-ads/social-media-advertisements.htm</a>. This site hosts 3500+ PDF files, each of which contains a picture of an ad and a series of descriptors associated with that ad, such as "Ad Creation Date" or "Ad Cost". I automatically extracted these pictures and text from each PDF file, and stored them in a database. Because these extraction methods are not foolproof, there may be typographical errors in the ad descriptors, and images that were not able to be extracted. I modified some ad descpitors for clarity (more on that below) and loaded the final results into a JSON database, from which the data for this website is loaded. You can download the original PDFs, as well as the text, images, and JSON files that were derived from it, at this Github repository: <a href="https://github.com/AndrewBeers/russian-ad-explorer">https://github.com/AndrewBeers/russian-ad-explorer</a>.

      <h3>Notes on Interest Categories</h3>
      The Russian Ad Explorer allows you to filter by "Interest Categories", a set of criteria that was not provided in the original dataset. I created Interest Categories by aggregating the descriptors "People Who Match", "And Must Also Match", "Behaviors", "Interest Expansion", and "Interests" into a smaller set of categories that referenced a similar set of ideas. I was able to extract over 800 separate categories from the original PDFs, and sorted them into a smaller set of 15 sub-categories. The decision to put an ad tag in one or multiple categories was entirely a judgment call, and you may disagree with some of the categorizations. Additionally, I may have been unsure how to categorize certain interests and target audiences, and left them out. In order to make transparent some of the choices made in these categorizations, I'll briefly define them below.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Progressive:</strong> Interest tags were chosen if they referred to media programs associated with progressive viewpoints, popular progressive figures, and slogans and ideas associated with progressive views. Some examples include: "Mumia Abu Jamal", "mother jones", and "Fight the Power". Notably, I sometimes excluded interests specifically associated with groups of people who are more likely to hold progressive views, such as Black Americans, as the IRA may have been targeting these groups with explicitly conservative ads. This, along with "Conservative" was among the most difficult to consistently judge, and may change in future iterations of this explorer.
      <br/><br/>
      <strong>Conservative:</strong>
      Interest tags were chosen if they referred to popular conservative figures, organizations, or symbols. Some examples include "breitbart", "Rand Paul", and "Confederate Flag". Like the "Progressive" category, it was often difficult to judge if an interest qualified as explicitly conservative, and future iterations of this explorer may change this category.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>African American:</strong>
      Interest tags were chosen if they referred to popular Black figures, Black media, events in Black history, or occasionally references to famous African leaders in postcolonial struggles. Some examples include: "Sister 2 Sister Magazine", "Black is Beautiful", "Martin Luther King", and "PanAfricanism". I excluded some tags that deal with social issues relating . References to postcolonial African leaders and movements were so numerous as to perhaps deserve their own category.

      <br />
      <h3>Additional Notes</h3>

      Each ad PDF came with a set of descriptors, but some ads had more descriptors than others. If an ad did not have a descriptor, or if it could not be transcribed during the PDF extraction process, its value is replace with "[Unavailable]". A few additional edits were made detailed below, as well as notes on other categories. <br />
      <br />
      <strong>Ad Creation Date:</strong>
      You can sort ads by the date that they were created. However, if the 'Ad Creation Date' was not provided, or was not transcribed correctly from the PDF, I used the 'Ad End Date' instead for sorting purposes.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Ad Spend:</strong>
      Original ad spend was provided in Rubles (RUB). Conversion to USD was calculated based on the rate at "Ad Creation Date" or "Ad End Date" (whichever was available), although I currently do not know if ads were paid for on the same day they were created.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Ad Impressions:</strong>
      According to Facebook, impressions are a proxy for "how often your ads were on screen for your target audience." You can read more about impressions at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/675615482516035">https://www.facebook.com/business/help/675615482516035</a>.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Placements:</strong>
      Where an ad will be placed. It is hard to tell what Facebook means by "Third Party Apps"; Facebook seems to have renamed this feature "Audience Network" -- you can read about it here: <a href="https://www.facebook.com/business/help/757929014342910?helpref=faq_content">https://www.facebook.com/business/help/757929014342910?helpref=faq_content</a>. There also seems to be more than "Video" placements, as some of the ads in this category don't seem to be videos.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Cost Efficiency and Conversion Rate:</strong>
      Cost efficiency was determined by dividing the US dollar price of an ad by either its clicks or impressions. Click conversion rates were determined by dividing impressions by clicks, to see how many people who saw an ad actually clicked on an ad. In at least one ad, there are more clicks than impressions, leading one to believe that Facebook may double-count clicks by the same user.
      <br /><br />
      <strong>Language:</strong>
      Although there are options for both English (UK) and English (US), they always appear together in these ads.
