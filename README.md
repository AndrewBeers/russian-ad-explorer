On May 10, 2018, Democrats on the United States House Intelligence Committee released 3,500+ ads created by the Internet Research Agency between 2015 and 2017. The Internet Research Agency is believed to have created these ads to influence the outcome of the 2016 United States presidential election, and in general influence Americans' political views.

This Github repository contains code for a visualization tool to view these ads, which can be viewed at this link: <a href="https://russian-ad-explorer.github.io">https://russian-ad-explorer.github.io</a>. Extensive documentation on design and presentation choices for this visualization tool can be found on the <a href="https://russian-ad-explorer.github.io/about">About</a> page of the explorer. The data that powers this tool is hosted on these Github repositories: <a href="https://github.com/russian-ad-explorer/russian-ad-datasets">russian-ad-datasets</a> and <a href="https://github.com/russian-ad-explorer/russian-ad-pdfs">russian-ads-pdfs</a>.

## Filter.js

This explorer is built on the filter.js library (<a href="https://github.com/jiren/filter.js">link</a>). I have a modified version of filter.js in this explorer that has a few additional lines in the "pagination" section to add features to the thumbnails.
