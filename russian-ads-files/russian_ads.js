We are just people, not criminals! AND WE LOVE CHILDREN, NOT RAPE!! We are all equal! It is better for child to live with homosexual parents then to live on the street or in orphanage! Millions of children need love and they don't care if our love is different. Why should we let those children that are left on the streets be on the streets when a warm and open home are open to them?! I don't understand!! ",

Just wanted to see if you could share my coming out as trans story on your page. I have been on a long, rough journey to this point and I think my story could help younger trans youth see that no matter how bad it gets it always gets better. I would really appreciate this because I want to become someone who inspires the LGBT community to be themselves! Ever since I was little, I knew I was different. I wasn't like any of the other kids. I had a unique way of thinking and often that left me isolated. Something I still feel the sting of today. Unlike most boys who played with Spiderman and Superman action figures when they were little, I played with barbies ... I wanted to look like them. I wanted to be them. It felt right playing with these dolls. I had to hide when I did it though because even at an early age, I knew boys weren't supposed to play with dolls. Once I had gotten got caught by my grandmother's ex husband and he told me to put them away and stop being a sissy .... \" Please spend 5 minutes to read this letter ... it is very important just to be heart ...  Thank you for your brave act! You are a true hero! Please share your stories and photos .... Inspire us and others! ",

    "ad_copy": "Made In The US: The Justice Turns Into BusinessFor years, inmates with non-violent felonies and misdemeanor charges in New York City had to sit in Rikers Island for months awaiting trial, 'cause they couldn't afford to pay bail. Under the city's new bail initiative announced by Mayor Bill de Blasio last week, some 3,000 low-level offenders are eligible for release without bail. The system needs serious reform. According to the New York Police Department, the biggest part of arrests are low-level offenses like peeing on the street or disorderly conduct. The New York Daily News reports that 81 percent of the 7.3 million people hit with summonses between 2001 and 2013 were black and Hispanic. So what should we do? The criminal penal system is antiquated. It should be changed. The worse, it is now designed to be for profit which has led to laws being designed to keep people in prison, rather than rehabilitating. More and more it looks like it's a business. The first rule of any society is development. At such rate the US government will start to sell indulgences soon. Our system is not only unfair, but also corrupt! We should explore alternative solutions and limit the number of people in prison to the most violent and potentially dangerous offenders. Only real criminals should be in jail! Lemme ask you, have you ever seen a one of the tobacco industry executives go to jail? I guess no. We also have never seen the Bush or any other Presidents administrations were brought to justice. America has a justice system that was supplanted the Jim Crow laws as a means to keep the minorities from developing real opportunities for keeping the very rich from ever being brought to justice.

Now, imagine... 70-years after the Third Reich was down, Berlin organizes Nazi military parade. Sounds weird; inconceivable right? So tell me, why KKK march at South Carolina Capitol draws the ire only of local African-Americans? A Ku Klux Klan chapter and an African-American group plan overlapping demonstrations on Saturday outside the South Carolina State House; where state officials removed the Confederate battle flag last week. We have been fought with slavery, Jim Crow laws and etc for REALLy long time so what's the problem today? Nothing good coming out of this mess. So what is the purpose of this march? Hmmm... It feels like this could be billed as \"the fight of the century.\" What do you think about it guys? ",

The second case over a week, huh? How retarded and/or brainwashed by Fox News is one supposed to be to believe this is a coincidence? No way we are gonna buy such bullshit. The weirdest thing about this specific case is that the suicide was committed just an hour after the arrest. Moreover, the woman was suspected of stealing someone's phone which is quite not a reason for getting to her account. We've got to also take into consideration that 1 in 3 black men go to prison as opposed to a considerably lower rate with the white men (http://www.alternet. org/story/154587/1 _in_3_black_men_g(:_to_prison_the_10_most_disturbing_ facts_about racial_inequality_in_the_u.s._criminal_justice_system). It definitely seems like there's more to this since until recently taking into custody hasn't been a reason for suicide among black women. Now for some people the only way to deal with police violence at the police stations is simply killing themselves... ",

Amari Brown, a 7-year-old boy on the city's West Side, was the youngest of the fatalities. Those 30 shootings came between 9:20 p.m Saturday and 4:45 a.m. Sunday. Amari had spent the day celebrating with family and riding his scooter up and down the block where he lived with his grandmother and several other relatives in Humboldt Park. Just before midnight, a gunman opened fire outside a relative's home where Amari and other children were playing, hitting both the 7-year-old and a 26-year-old woman in the chest. No arrests have been made. Family members will hold a press conference Sunday afternoon to call for Amari's killer to turn himself in. How can we feel safe here in America? Permanent threat to life follows every American like a shadow. What did this boy do to deserve a bullet in his body? He just played with his friends outdoor. Is human life really worth nothing in our country? Rest in peace, Amari Brown. ",

Sometimes it makes me actually think that when not involved in any military operations in the foreign countries, our country's at war with its own citizens with the help of police. ",

    "ad_copy": "Marine Corps General Joseph Dunford told the Congress last week that thedeaths of 500 soldiers in Iraq and Afghanistan could be attributed to Iran. This statement sounds strange on the background of rapproachment between Obama's administration and Tehran. Although, this rapproachment in itself looks strange. We would remind you that Tehran has never expressed its condolences for the Iran hostage crisis. Moreover, the Supreme Leader of Iran Ali Hosseini Khamenei is too disrespectful to the United States despite of friendly actions of Obama's administration. And Iranian military command claims that Iran is ready to come into collision with America at any moment. The Iran deal is a shame of the United States. Senate Republicans were right when they expressed their distrust of Iranian government. It's not clear why Obama has refused containment of Iran that is an potential enemy not only for the United States, but also for the rest world. Barack Obama is, by all appearances, a true traitor of the United States. And it's not empty words — the rapprochement with Iran is either a treachery or stupidness. ",

According to WSB-TV in Atlanta, the organization calls for the removal of all symbols of the Confederacy from the park, as well as any other state-owned buildings, parks and lands. The USA is out of balance now. We loose our history! The gays, lesbians and trans-sexuals have more rights now then other folks. They bring pervert culture in our houses as something normal. Today, LGBT community has turned into the head and everyone else is the tail. We inherit the history, we make it, and we are fated to become part of it. What kind of inheritage next generation will get? The rainbow flag that is offensive and a symbol of hate. Instead of delete a big part of our history, can we ban the rainbow from public display? ",

Authorities say a man was a practicing Muslim. At present FBI is conducting an investigation. According to his beliefs, Mohammad was a fundamental Islamist. Having examined after his death his social pages, FBI has found that he kept a blog and had a note where he said that he conducted a terrorist act in obedience to Allah. It is notable that the terrorist attack was conducted in the last day of Ramadan. It is noteworthy that in his letter the terrorist didn't refer to ISIS or AI-Qaeda; he acted in his own volition. We don't want to stir up Islamophobia, but if such manifestations of Islam have place, it is very sorrowful for the United States. The situation in the Middle East and the extensive propaganda of ISIS make ordinary Muslims to become radical Islamists and take the path of war and death. If people on their own commit such attacks, the American society must take it more seriously. The society should develop a new behavioral model towards Islam, according to which, on the one hand Muslims and Christians will live comfortable together. And on the other hand, Muslims won't tend to radical activities and the destruction of peaceful life of Americans. ",

About 2,000 people arrived to South Carolina's statehouse. Some of them present the KKK's rally against the removal of the Confederate flag, while others were from the New Black Panther party and Black Lives matter groups, holding the Republic of New Afrika flag. It is a very clear signal for the federal government that the protest obtains a systematic and ideological basis. The Klan wanted to underline the traditional heritage of the Confederate flag. Black protesters, on the contrary stand against racism. There were also many anti-racism supporters of other races. The main problem is hatred which is spread among our society. The government does nothing to solve the matter. If America is a land of free, we should clear our country of racism. But on the other hand we shouldn't refuse our history and our traditions. ",

President Obama hasn't ordered to lower a flag, though a federal law states that the flag shall be flown at half-staff upon the deaths of principal figures or the governor can lower the US flag in his or her state following the deaths of officials or members of the US Army. By contrast, Obama ordered the flags to half-staff following on the same day that as the shootings at the Sandy Hook Elementary School. The flag was lowered to half-staff the day following the terrorist attack during the Boston marathon, the shooting at the Washington Navy Yard and the following the death of Nelson Mandela. But it hasn't yet been lowered in honor of the service members murdered in Tennessee. By doing so Obama shows the highest degree of disrespect for the fallen soldiers. It turns out that for him the soldiers as well as veterans do not deserve any attention or respect. Soldiers are needed only when it is necessary to send them to the next unknown operation. They considered as meat. But in reality, they are our heroes! They were victims of a terrorist attack. They were victims of a man who at first won refugee status and then decided to kill in the name of Allah. In general during the Obama presidency the country was divided in many ways: racism became more evident, the number of illegal immigrants, who do not even bother to learn English, because it's enough to speak Spanish, has increased.

The outrage was caused by artist's artwork recreating iconic Iwo Jima photo. with a gay pride flag and half-naked men has received death threats. That's a bit too harsh treatment for an artist, don't you think? What's this; the American version of Je suis Charlie? Joe Rosenthal's picture of soldiers hauling a flag pole up after declaring the island of Iwo Jima secure during the Second World War won the Pulitzer Prize in 1945. Around 70.000 U.S. troops fought more than 20,000 Japanese. It wasn't a fair fight back then, and it's not a fair fight today. But there's nothing disrespectful in this image. Isn't the imitation is the best form of homage? #homophobia #JoeRosenthal #EdFreeman #IwoJlma ",

Mike Lee has been anti-LGBT conservatives' top priority since the Supreme Court brought marriage equality to all 50 states. It's part of the National Organization for Marriage's post-Obergefell plan and Republican presidential candidate pledge, and the Family Research Council mentions it almost daily. Lee joined NPR this week to defend the bill, basically admitting that all it does is enable anti-gay discrimination. Lee framed his concern as one about the government discriminating against religious institutions —for discriminating against people in same-sex marriages. It's the latter he wants to allow by ensuring that the government never penalizes any religious institution that refuses to recognize a same-sex couple's marriage, or employ them, house them, or serve them. Mr. Lee, you are ridiculous! You're just going to have to get over that fact that we have full Federal civil rights now. Or don't! We will go on happily living our lives while you froth at the mouth and throw a fit because we're being treated equally under the law! ",

    "ad_copy": "PLEASE NO HATE! JUST LET US EAT CAKE!Wedding cake is back in the news with developments in both the Oregon and Colorado bakery cases involving discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation. In Oregon,judgment has been finalized against Sweet Cakes by Melissa, requiring Aaron and Melissa Klein to pay a $135,000 fine for refusing service to a same-sex couple. Meanwhile, in Colorado, Jack Phillips of Masterpiece Cakeshop, is appealing the ruling against him for refusing to serve a same-sex couple. In the wake of the Supreme Court's ruling in Obergefell v. Hodges, conservatives are eager to highlight Phillips and the Kleins as evidence that religious freedom is under attack. In fact, they have actually invented a new claim about how these bakers' \"free speech\" is under attack and how they're thus the real victims. There's a simple solution. Since they won't agree to the conditions for having a license to do business with the public, they shouldn't have a license to do business with the public! This is not a free speech issue, it is an issue of American law! They can speak about their bigotry and ignorance, not to practice it! ",

The popular show is based on a young boy named Steven, who grows up with three magical aliens — the 'Crystal Gems' Garnet, Amethyst and Pearl. The show, which has already won praise for including a number of strong, female characters in a comparatively male-dominated genre, has now hinted at further diversity. That's s000 nice!

For decades, conservative Christians who oppose LGBT equality have singled out the federal government or secular atheists as their preferred enemy in public settings, blasting both groups for supposedly attacking \"traditional marriage\" or infringing on their religious liberty. Yet in the months surrounding the recent U.S. Supreme Court decision to legalize same-sex marriage across the country, right-wing Christians have become increasingly willing to cast blame — seemingly hypocritically — on a group they have often dismissed or outright ignored: Progressive Christians, especially those who support marriage equality. I believe religions should teach love, they must stop teaching hatred! And noticed while progressive Christians are constantly under attack from conservative Christians, they're not the ones screaming \"persecution\". They are just tired of the persecution. ",

The Boy Scouts of America's ban on gay adults has stood as a towering example of explicit, institutional homophobia in one of America's most important and recognizable civic organizations.

    "ad_copy": "SOLDIER SHANE.Recently Pentagon confirmed plan to lift ban on transgender military service. Let's meet the big player in repealing the ban. Sergeant Shane Ortega, 28, doesn't stand out or appear out of the ordinary among his fellow Army soldiers. But there's one thing that differs him from the bulk of troops. Shane is the first openly trans soldier of the US Army. He's astonishingly handsome, he works out constantly (check out his muscular build), he covered in tattoos, he's part black, Latino and Cherokee, he's obsessed with his girlfriend (a former model and aspiring doctor); and he gets giddy talking about both video games and chopping wood in Alaska. Yet despite his solid performance and commitment to serve, SGT Ortega has been at risk of getting kicked out of the Army because in official Army paperwork, he is identified as a woman. But the real warriors never surrender! Ortega struggled for the equal rights for the transgender people in the military. And he succeeded! America's military progressing slowly towards inclusion and equal opportunity. Let's hope that these changes'll ensure peace, instead of waging more war. #Igbt #transgender #equality #usarmy #Ortega ",

STOP DISCRIMINATION AGAINST HOMOSEXUAL TEACHERS!!After eight years on the job, Margie Winters was fired as director of religious education at Waldron Mercy Academy outside Philadelphia not because she just married her wife, but because some parents just found out that she's been married for all eight years. Unfortunately LGBT teachers have long understood that openly expressing their identity in school can make them an easy target for discrimination. It is the biggest mistake! When students perceive that they're not supposed to talk about homosexuality, they conclude that there must be something wrong about being gay. And it's a dangerous message that can lead to bullying and harassment. Gay teachers need to serve as example for kids! It's very powerful both for straight students and for LGBT students to know that they have teachers and people they respect who are LGBT and who are good at their jobs. It's important for all students to see that nothing to be ashamed! And it must be illegal for employers to discriminate against employees based on their actual or perceived sexual orientation! ",

Police said Ware ran into nearby woods and struggled with officers when they caught up with him. Officers sprayed him with oleoresin capsicum, more commonly known as pepper spray, according to police. The chemical agent debilitates a person by causing temporary blindness and irritating a person's nose and throat. The six officers who were involved in Ware's case will remain on duty during an investigation, according to police. Officials said police car dash cam and body camera footage of the incident would be released after that investigation. This tragedy happen accidentally, and probably the police officers didn't wish death upon him, because they tried to give him first aid. However, the man is dead and there is no chance to rewind and bring him back. He's gone forever, but the cops will remain on duty and get away with this murder. Is this acceptable? We will know about he process of detention after the investigation is over. Let's wait and keep our eyes open. Black Lives Matter! ",

I can't breathe.\" On Wednesday night, a white police officer in the small town of Stonewall, Mississippi allegedly strangled Sanders, a 39-year-old black horseman, with a flashlight before killing him in view of his family members. Officer Kevin Herrington pulled Sanders off a horse and choked him with a flashlight, Sander's attorney, Stewart Parrish, initially told an ABC affiliate. Parrish later clarified that those allegations came from family members who witnessed the death. Parrish said that Sanders experienced \"some kind of asphyxiation\" during the altercation. Sanders died on the scene and leaves behind two children. The last words of Eric garner were \"I can't breathe,\" the last words of Jonathan Sanders were \"I can't breathe, let me go\". Biting irony, isn't it? Since when is it illegal to train your horse in close propinquity to your house? America was always (and it is now)a police state for black people. ",

    "ad_copy": "Ta-Nehisi Coates on growing up in West BaltimoreThe famous African-American writer Ta-Nehisi Coates grew up in West Baltimore with people who lost a child whether to the streets, to guns or to jail. Today, his goal is to protect his son from the different forms of violence that he experienced in school and on the streets. People of color have been dealing with injustice ever since they crossed the North American continent. For instance, in West Baltimore, Ta-Nehisi was trained not to go to the neighborhoods unless you know this place. He was told that you cannot tolerate anybody attempting any physically violent threat to you. Moreover, his mom was feared that her children would get arrested. What does it mean? Undoubtedly, black Americans were afraid of police, improper procedure, injustice or what is worse, being killed by police officer. That's why the nationwide furor over the growing number of unarmed black men fatally shot by police officers has put the public on a new trend in America. In fact, this new trend caused disproportionate number of unarmed people of color killed by police. How dangerous is to live in your area today? ",

A predominantly Melbourne black church was vandalized for the third time in six months. According to the Melbourne Police Department, the vandal bought axes to chop through access points to get in. Church Bishop Jacquelyn Gordon said that the church was in the process of development since they moved two years ago into 125,000 foot industrial complex. Moreover, the message \"SS Charleston 2\" was found on the car nearby the Church, which raised concerns about church security. SS Charleston 2 indicates the tragedy in Charleston when nine people were shot to death by white supremacist Dylann Roof at Emanuel AME church. Before, the church members found the words \"We see u\" that were painted in the radical emblem of the Nazi party swastika. How many hateful people living in America today? What of these people are getting their hatred and racism from their parents or friends? What if it is a hate crime? Has the government created a fund to assist this church? ",

    "ad_copy": "Amandla Stenberg: Black Female Bodies Are Treated As Less Than Human\"Do black females lives matter, too?\" That's the big question 16-year-old Amandla Stenberg posed on Instagram on Sunday. The powerful post broke down the cultural double standards that plague black women every day. \"Black features are beautiful, black women are not,\" Stenberg wrote. \"White women are paragons of virtue and desire, black women are objects of fetishism and brutality. This, at least, seems to be the mentality surrounding black femininity and beauty in a society built upon eurocentric beauty standards.\" Everybody knows that racism is alive and prospering in America. However, all the news about killing black men and black teenagers, police brutality, unfair sentences and other issues, distract us from the fact that black women are being abused in the most violent ways. Usually they can't stand up for themselves unlike men, so they endure and suffer. In modern America black women experience more depression than probably during slavery, when everything was obvious, but now racism is hidden behind the mask of tolerance. ",

Well, then how come Detroit is no less dangerous then (the city ranks third in the list of top 100 US most dangerous cities)?? When 24-year-old DaJuawn Wallace saw flashing blue police lights in his rearview mirror he chose to proceed with caution since some people are known to be robbed by fake police officers. He preferred to find a well-lit area to pull over in. As a result, he was charged with 'fleeing' police. People are terrified by the police to such a degree that they even prefer to communicate with officers only in the well-lit areas. And get charged for that. Sometimes it makes me actually think that when not involved in any military operations in the foreign countries, our country's at war with its own citizens with the help of police. ",

Hallinan announced his store's new policy sitting against the Confederate flag. The video posted in Facebook became popular. What we can say? Hallinan is completely right! If the government cannot provide our security, then we must do everything possible to provide it. A lot of Muslims become Islamists, who pose a real threat to our national security. We consider that it is really dangerous to sell arms to Muslims, as there're a lot of terrorists among them. The 2nd amendment was written for people, but it doesn't relieve people of responsibility.

    "ad_copy": "A number of refugees has increased since Obama became the PresidentStates across the country were filled with flows of refugees since Obama became the President. The U.S. refugee admissions database wrapsnet.org states that 437,829 new refugees came to the USA since Obama first took office. Most of them were placed in Texas (46,351), California (44,162) and New York (26,293). Many of refugees were placed in Ohio (14,855), Florida (21,613), Virginia (9,395), Colorado (11,300) and Nevada (3,421). Such active provision of a shelter for refugees sooner or later will lead to the fact that the number of terrorist attacks in the USA will increase. The US Homeland Security Committee considers that the administration is admitting too many refugees from Iraq and Syria, a hotbed of ISIS terrorism. Perhaps new terrorist attacks won't be so large as the 9/11 but there will be more terrorist attacks if the immigration policy won't be tightened. We have a lot of problems that require an active response and decisions from the government: poverty, the problems of veterans, homelessness, racism, law enforcement system and so on. Is it possible to offer a better life for refugees if not all US citizens live normally? ",

    "ad_copy": "The Census Bureau published the new data in its International Data Base,which contains population estimates and projections up to the year 2050. The figure from the Census Bureau is a calculation of net migration—meaning the total number of immigrants who will arrive in the United States in 2015 would actually be larger than 1.24 million. Of course, the United States is the country of immigrants. But if America had huge undeveloped lands and needed workers at the earliest stage, today there is a jobs deficit. Today the government must restrict immigration that is a reason of interethnic tensions in the United States. High unemployment rate fuels intolerance toward immigrants that are ready to work illegally for low wages. So, besides social problem, immigrants threaten the U.S. economy. Those who work illegaly don't pay taxes that are an important part of state budget. Working illegaly, they break the law. Lack of immigration restrictions increases crime rates. Moreover, more and more immigrants cannot speak English. One-fifth of people in the United States speak a foreign language at home, according to a report of the Center for Immigration Studies. You see, increasing ammount of immigrants in the United States creates social and economic problems. However, we have a risk not only to worsen the U.S. economy, but also to lose our culture. America can't be the Tower of Babel, we cannot allow everybody to live here if immigration threatens us. We don't hate foreigners, we are glad to see tourists from every corner of the world, but we cannot allow them to stay here. It's the bathos of stupidity to stimulate immigration when it creates enormous problems for the nation. ",

But she also dedicated a significant percentage of her speech to a thoughtful and touching discussion of the vast number of issues facing the larger transgender community. In her past life Caitlyn was known worldwide as a sports hero. Today she is an American hero of a great courage.

According to reports, she is now dating Candis Cayne, 44, an actress and a fellow transgender woman. Caitlyn and Candis had amazing chemistry. After her monumental life change, Caitlyn's ready to open up her heart again and really, how could you ask for a more perfect fit as a romantic partner than Candis? She's been basically through the same struggles and confusion, so she'd be the perfect person for Caitlyn to lean on as she continues her journey of transition. Candis is smart, funny, talented and drop-dead sexy! ",

It is good to be happy! Maybe one day our rights won't be determined based on what group we belong to. Until then some will be more equal than others.

So, a family from Moseley, Virginia was threatened at gunpoint for waving the Confederate flag on their own private property on Monday night. While the family was expressing their First Amendment right by waving the flag in their own driveway next to a busy highway. A man driving an SUV pulled into the driveway, took out his gun, chambered a round, pointed it at the family. \"He slammed on the brakes and when he got right beside me, he pulled out a gun, chambered a round and told me my cause wasn't worth anything now,\" Mark Wilson said. When one spits upon the law because he thinks that it's amoral, it is beginning a chaos. Liberals want to ban a confederate flag because slavery was in the 18th and 19th centuries. They don't want to understand that slavery was legal in many countries of the world, but nobody wants to ban a flag of England or France. Activists and groups like the NAACP are also calling for statues and monuments to Confederate leaders to be demolished, including the carving at Stone Mountain, the largest bas relief sculpture in the world. Some are even demanding that Washington, DC be renamed in the name of political correctness because George Washington owned slaves. Liberals actually want to destroy American history and culture. Americans should be guided by the law, because sometimes moral is not clear. If somebody thinks that the Democratic party is amoral, nobody demands to eliminate the party. Continue to stay for the First amendment! Let's stop the chaos! ",

Of course marriage is good for the business - no matter who it is that is marrying. It's a billion dollar industry in our country! I am certain that if a state supported marriage for all, then business would flourish. No one would be offended by not being considered legitimate, when their feelings are legitimate. ",

People trying to change the gender on a passport only need to be in transition, not post-surgery. But many transgender people never complete the surgery due to economical reasons, health issues etc. It seems that the law does not care about these people's circumstances. So typical of bureaucrats. It is very important for every transgender to be able to change his\\her identification to reflect who they really are. It's not just about person dressed as a man one day and then dressed as a woman the next, or vice versa. It is about much more deep, more complex things. An authentic transgender man or woman only presents as the gender they truly are; And not the gender they were assigned to at birth. Transgender people are not trying to trick anyone by asking for identification changes. They are trying to avoid as much confusion as absolutely possible. Because it is confusing enough to be the gender different from the one you were assigned to at birth. Please share your stories with us, because united we can stand against injustice and inequality! #Kentucky #transgender #inequality #discrimination ",

    "ad_copy": "Cleveland judge won't be forced to issue warrants in Rice shootingA divided Ohio appeals court panel on Friday said it would not force a municipal judge to issue arrest warrants for Cleveland police officers involved in the fatal shooting of 12-year-old Tamir Rice in a city park last November. Cleveland Municipal Court Judge Ronald Adrine in June found probable cause for Officer Timothy Loehmann, who shot Rice, and his partner, Frank Garmback, to face charges in the shooting. Loehmann shot Rice twice within seconds of arriving outside a city recreation center on Nov. 22 in response to an emergency call of a man with a gun. Rice, who was playing with an Airsoft-type replica handgun that shoots pellets, died the next day. By any means the justice system is trying to justify the cops, who should've been never employed even. They shot the poor kid in 2 seconds after they arrived, not even having time to understand the situation. Everyday police use excessive force and weapons against unarmed people. Killers in uniform... Let's honor Tamir's memory one more time. ",

Not seven years ago, her teenage daughter was accidentally shot to death. This time, a firearm in the hand of her son, Brandon Claxton, 16, prompted an officer to shoot him three times about 7:15 p.m. Saturday in a housing complex in the 2500 block of Hodiamont Avenue, officials said. Police encountered him while responding to a call about someone with a stolen pistol. His mother said that she respected the police and that her son \"shouldn't have had the gun.\" But from what witnesses have told her, she said, \"They didn't have to shoot him down like that.\" One of three witnesses interviewed Sunday told a reporter that Brandon did have a gun in his hand. But all three said that he did not point a weapon at anyone as he tried to run from officers. When a white guy walks around with a rifle, nobody bats an eye. When a black guy walks with a pistol (or even a toy gun)- he'll be immediately shot by the police. Have you ever heard about open carry in the United States? Then here we go. Racial prejudice at its finest. Our condolences to the family. ",

Hodges refused to leave his house after he was not able to pay his mortgage while caring for his sick wife. Police and ambulance workers had to carry him away on a stretcher. A 90-year-old Navy veteran lived in his Buffalo home with his wife for decades. But about four years ago; he was taking care of his wife, who had Alzheimer's disease and spent all his income on her rehabilitation. In the process, he defaulted on his mortgage and amassed a huge debt totaling $73;000 to M&T Bank. Unfortunately, due to his default on his mortgage loan payments, he was evicted from his house on a stretcher. Why does the U.S. government treat military veterans absolutely disgracefully? Why the WWII veterans are literally being treated like human garbage by their own government? How potentially disabled veteran was evicted from his house? How come homelessness and unemployment among American veterans is much higher today than for the general population of the United States of America? ",

On June 29 he was fired amid allegations leveled against white officers of departmental racism. After that the crowd of Sewell's supporters moved to voice their outrage to the Pocomoke City Council with posters that read \"We Support Chief Kelvin Sewell.\" As a nation we have looked the other way for far too long and it is disgraceful! This time we're not fighting with police, we're fighting for justice. The system is broken, police doesn't protect us and the government cares only about tycoons' interests. So here's a question - who will care about Americans who can't protect themselves? Who will care about us? #JusticeforChiefSewell ",

Being one of the 17 children of former slaves she was the first and the only child to go to African-American school. She found the Daytona Normal and Industrial Institute for Negro Girls because she believed that education was the key to racial advancement. In addition; Bethune did a lot of work to contribute to American society. For instance; she was the president of the Florida chapter of the National Association of Colored Women. Moreover. in 1935 Mary Bethune became an advisory to President Roosevelt on minority affairs and later on she started her civil rights organization. the National Council of Negro Women. The great educator and civil right activist Mary McLeod Bethune demonstrated the values of education. the philosophy of love and the wise use of power. Sadly. at least 10 years of data reveals that Congress don't pay attention to American civil rights as Mary McLeod Bethune did 80 years ago. ",

A Maryland town several weeks ago fired its firstblack Police Chief, now exposing a racial rift The leaders of small Maryland's city in Eastern Shore fired the Pocomoke City's first black police Chief Kelvin Sewell due to his incompetence and refusal to fire black police officers Franklin Savage and Lynell Green. Chief Sewell was hired by Pocomoke City back in 2010 after his retirement from the Baltimore Police Department. Earlier, before Sewell's dismissal he filed a complaint on unequal employment opportunities claiming he was paid less than his white predecessors. This is circumstantial evidence that America is divided into different parts based on race and income. Racism has gotten so bad, black people are treated unfairly. If God created us equally, why the unequal treatment of minorities still exists in our country? What if the firing gas stirred a new spirit of African-American activism? ",

How many protests have been held since 2013? How useful were protests? According to analysis by AP, 24 states have put 40 new laws to tackle police violence such as use of police officer body cameras, racial-bias training and surplus of military equipment. However, there is more work to be done to solve racial tensions in America. The public stand against discrimination happens when there is lack of inside connections with the government. People attempt to stop racism the government usually assumes to be problematic but protesters force the government to find compromise. It's a well known fact, when governments do not deliver, people protest. ",

When police officer tried to arrest him, Labriado yelled several times \"This is for the black people\". What if Labriado sought to revenge for all black lives that officers took away? Racism obviously gave rise to the tensions in society that led to disrespect and hate. Moreover, black people are fed up with racism and police violence towards black community. What is more, racial tensions have gotten worse under the current government. Even after several months of protests over the deaths of Eric Garner, Tamir Rice, Michael Brown, Sandra Bland and Freddie Gray the government inspired more unrest. Today black community is in desperate situation seeking for help. ",

Officer Troy Middlebrooks kept his job and continues to patrol Alexander City after authorities there paid the man $35,000 to avoid being publicly sued over the incident. Middlebrooks, a veteran of the US marines, said the man \"needs a god damn bullet\" and allegedly referred to him as \"that nigger\", after becoming frustrated that the man was not punished more harshly over a prior run-in. The payment was made to the black resident, Vincent Bias, after a secret recording of Middlebrooks's remarks was played to the city's police chiefs and the mayor. Elected city councillors said they were not consulted. Do you know that you can go to prison for murderous intent? However, if you are a white police officer, offering to KILL a BLACK AMERICAN and then hide the evidence, then you don't even get fired. Oh yeah, it's happening in a wonderful state called Alabama! You know how it works here. Do you have any more questions for American law enforcement system? ",

    "ad_copy": "Young, Unarmed Black Man Killed By Cop Didn't Want To'Die Too Young'An unarmed black teenager in Texas was shot dead by a cop who had only recently graduated from the police academy. Just over a week before his death, he posted that he doesn't want to die too young on Twitter. Officers responded to a burglary call around 1 a.m. on Friday, hearing reports that a suspect was damaging vehicles. First spotting Taylor moving about the lot, officers also noticed Taylor's SUV had been smashed into the front of the dealership showroom. Finding that Taylor had moved inside the showroom, Arlington Police Chief Police Will Johnson said Taylor would not comply when told to lie down on the ground, but fled to a back room. 49-year-old officer Brad Miller entered the showroom to arrest Taylor, and then an altercation broke out. Miller fired four shots, including the fatal bullets from the gun of Miller. A second officer fired a taser, Johnson said. And now there are three main points that you should think of: 1) Taylor was described as a good kid. He was a football player at Angelo State University. Never was involved in criminal activities. 2) The officer graduated from the police academy less than 6 months ago and was working under the supervision of a training officer. 3) Taylor didn't want to die young. Black teens don't really live, they survive. And, unfortunately, there is no one to save them from death. There is no one to stop police brutality. We all want our kids to feel safe, we want them to be safe and sound. Are our hopes doomed to disappointment? ",

Just 90 miles, but at the same time it is a vast schism that separates the United States from Cuba. The poet added he hopes there's still possible to achieve \"healing\" between the two countries. `This very moment, the negotiation of cultural identities...This just seems so surreal still... This is really in some sense just the beginning, the dawn of new things to come.' It would be so great if it will be indeed a new hope and a new day for Cuba, country which is still struggling to recover from severe embargo, country abused by wars. Sadly, the United States participated and initiated many of these conflicts... And there's more - severe economic crisis, socialist dictatorship of Cuban leaders.

The 63-year-old comedian, who had struggled with depression, died by suicide on August 11 2014. His widow Susan Schneider said at the time of his death: \"As he is remembered, it is our hope the focus will not be on Robin's death, but on the countless moments of joy and laughter he gave to millions.\" Even at home, Williams exhibited acceptance for the LGBT community with his trademark playfulness. While he denied rumours about being gay, he had no qualms about discussing the sexuality of his pet pug. He said: \"I also have a gay rescue pug called Leonard. He has a boyfriend and they are planning to adopt a Siamese kitten together. We're very modern.\" When the Westboro Baptist announced its intentions to picket his funeral, proLGBT organisation Planting Peace raised over $40,000 for St. Jude Children's Research Hospital —one of Williams' favourite charities. Robin Williams played many different roles in so many people's lives, and giving back to others was at the top of that list... We will never forget you. And we'll always love you... ",

As a result, many were unable treatments for their gender dysphoria, a state of emotional distress caused by how the gender someone was designated at birth conflicts with their gender identity. Coming out as transgender requires telling everyone in your life about you and enduring the consequences which often means the loss of family, lifelong friends, your job, and being the subject of ridicule, discrimination, and often violence. No one makes the decision easily and no one transitions unless they have to do so. Transphobic slur of stupid politicians like GOP presidential hopeful Mike Huckabee seeking to tremendous efforts of transgender community who are still struggle for equal rights. We know how easily bigots and fools who has power are able to reverse progressive changes for their own benefit. We can't let that happen! These people know what it means to be Transgender and know what it is to serve in our Armed Forces. We respect their opinion in both of these areas, especially over those of Governor Huckabee who has not experienced or accomplished either. #transgender #military #equality #transphobia #mikehackabee ",

The founder and editor-in-chief of Black Millennial and one of the organizers of Black Lives Matter NYC Arielle Newton is 23-years-old. She is black college-educated woman who is drawing in $160,000 student loan debt. Today, Arielle is centered on the roots causes racism and resulting epidemic discrimination and socioeconomic illness. In fact, in her opinion the candidates for the next president of the United States of America are problematic in terms of lack of transparency and accountability. For instance, one candidate is complicit in fueling the war on drugs; another one in corrupted criminal justice system, next one in making racial justice as the centerpiece of the campaign as a strategy to have more black voters. Doubtless, voting won't bring us safety and won't provide us an immediate conduit for our social well-being. Ironically, even the first black president of the United States of America was not able to withstand the racist opposition and law enforcement. It means voting again for anti-black system won't save black lives, but might jeopardize it. ",

St. Louis police fatally shot a black teenager while tryingto issue search warrant On Wednesday, Aug. 19 racial tensions again sparked in Missouri city after St. Louis police officers fatally shot black teenager at Walton Avenue and Page Boulevard while trying to issue search warrant. According to St. Louis Police Chief San Dotson, a young black man pointed a gun at officers and was trying to escape from a house where officers were carrying out a search warrant for him. The 33-year-old and 20-year-old officers who shot the suspect four times were about seven years on the force. That was followed by crowd of 150 people who gathered by intersection. Later on, nine people were arrested on charges of resisting arrest. The protesters said that the police provoked the situation. What do you think about it? What if this situation makes us want to keep the police out of our neighborhood? Why do you think police shoots first and then asks questions? Do you realize that the shooting came just ten days after St. Louis was flooded with protesters who were marking the anniversary of Michael Brown? What if the city and the government needs to center its attention on racism and discrimination in America instead of suspecting every single black men? We cannot accept the fact that police can easily kill black people in America, than we must do something about it. Protest or accept it. You choose. This is your life. ",

Black Americans often complaint about being pulled over for the phenomenon called \"driving while black\". For example, a rich African American driving new Ferrari can be stopped hundreds of times for no apparent reason just because the fact that a black man driving an expensive car attract the attention of the police officers. But what if racial profiling ends with lethal consequences? Do you remember Sandra Bland who had run-ins with the police while driving? Do you all remember that she was found dead in police custody? Do we all have to avoid traffic stops in order to survive? For the matter of fact, the routine traffic stops are being a big deal for the people of color. According to the Justice Department statistics, black drivers are about 31 percent more likely to be subject to police than whites. Overall, this number indicates the racial difference in America. ",

You never know if a simple traffic stop will end up with you in a police custody or bullets in your chest. Unfortunately, many of Americans feel very uncomfortable talking about these issues, which seem to confirm the idea that the government remain silent. Nevertheless, one should accept that African-Americans are more likely to be targeted by police officers on the street than whites. Therefore it endangers the rights of black community. Doubtless when the government defends the officers who have killed black men, it strikes us how unfair the system is and reaffirms our view that America would spend billions of dollars on radical extremists than talking about the domestic terrorism, racial inequality and police brutality.

Instead, he said, \"If you have known me from when I was in elementary school at Huntertown Elementary until now, you've known me as black or bi-racial.\" Turning blackness into a performance is anti-blackness—irrespective of whether the white person doing it is Rachel Dolezal or Shaun King.

A copy of the alert said that the wife of a U.S. military member was approached in front of her home in Colorado by two men. The incident took place in May. Similar incidents in Wyoming repeated in June. We see that the threat of possible ISIS attack on families of the U.S. military has risen. And when the threat is so real the US intelligence agencies are doing nothing. As a matter of the fact they don't fully perform their duties. First of all, the US security forces should take all appropriate measures to identify people who scour after the wives and children of the U.S. Military. Secondly, families of the U.S. Military should be taken under special protection of the police and the FBI. If even one hair of the U.S. Military family members will be lost then the work of American secret services isn't worth a dime as they cannot maintain security on the American soil. In case of a negative scenario there won't be any need in their work. And this will be the final nail in the coffin of the American secret services. Let's remember the last FBI and NSA failures, such as failure to stop the Boston Marathon Bombings and so on. Our soldiers fight for America at the other end of the world and they deserve that their families should be kept safe. ",

The government spent more than $120 billion on the conflict in Vietnam from 1965-73 that led to the widespread inflation. Psychological effects were even deeper. The war had pierced the myth of American invincibility, and had bitterly divided the nation. Many returning veterans faced negative reactions from both opponents of the war and its supporters. In 1982, the Vietnam Veterans Memorial was created in Washington, D.C. There the names of 57,939 American armed forces killed or missing during the war are inscribes.

Yesterday night. a group of 50 protesters burned Confederate flag and tried to shutdown a freeway in Downtown Oakland. The opposition to police violence was in response to the police shooting earlier in the day. According to Oakland Police Department, yesterday at 2:39 p.m. in the area of 69th Avenue and International Boulevard. Oakland police officers spotted a vehicle they believe to be connected to a previous robbery on July 27. The pursuit started when the driver fled through Oakland streets until the suspect crashed into another car in the area of 27th Avenue and Martin Luther King Jr. street. But when the suspect ran of the car, three officers opened fire. The suspect Joe Bart has died at the hospital. Did you know that it was fifth shooting this year that involved police officers? How quickly it has become so usual? Why it has become so legit? Where is the government speaking about the existence of racism in America? Black Lives Matter! ",

Tina Carter-Shileds has five kids and three of them recently started to drive. The first thought she had when they wanted to drive alone was 'Wait a minute. I'm really scared right now.' What should they do if they get pulled over? What if they do something they don't supposed to be doing? It is not always fair when officers arrest African Americans, but it's a reality. What if police officers will automatically assume that your child is criminal because of how him or her looks. Black parents should remember that their kids will always be judged by the way they look. That's why it's important to instruct our children how to react when you are in trouble with law enforcement. Because if a stranger follows your child after him/her buy a bag of Skittles, ran back into the store. Remember, anything is better than dying. Anyways, it's hard to believe that in 21 st century black parents have to teach their children both survive and thrive. But who will take responsibility for training police officers? ",

The movie is coming this weekend in the theaters. However, some of the cinemas refused to show the movie, citing \"safety and liability\" concerns. Does it remind you of anything? How about Ferguson? How about Baltimore? Today you are willing to be detained in the name of defending your rights. Today cops can easily shoot you for a small violation. Even having black cops and black mayors doesn't end police brutality. Fortunately today you are allowed to record police officers in order to further prevent potentially serious cases of police wrongdoing fairly. ",

Witnesses told LaBouvier that police had been called because the man was waving sticks,\" which later turned out to be his crutches. None of the employees at Twitter or other tech companies came out to object as the 14 officers took down the one-legged homeless man. The U.S. Justice Department recently filed court documents in an Idaho case which declared it unconstitutional to criminalize homelessness. According to the Coalition on Homelessness, the city handed out 11,000 citations to homeless people who were sitting on sidewalks between 7 a.m. and 11 p.m. in 2014. What kind of people police usually hire? Mentally unstable bloodthirsty cowards or? We already know the answer. Sometimes we all wonder do police officers have mercy for anyone? Hard to say, because what we see confuses us. ",

The lion's share of these visas are for lesser-skilled and lower-paid workers and their dependents who, because they are here on work-authorized visas, are added directly to the same labor pool occupied by current unemployed jobseekers. Expressly because they arrive on legal immigrant visas, most will be able to draw a wide range of taxpayer-funded benefits, and corporations will be allowed to directly substitute these workers for Americans. Improved border security would have no effect on the continued arrival of these foreign workers, refugees, and permanent immigrants—because they are all invited here by the federal government. Obama swore an oath to uphold our Constitution and protect the American people but he has done everything in his power to destroy us.

They want to keep the border open so violent illegal aliens can victimize our citizens Jindal said that in a trip to the border, he witnessed illegal aliens easily gaining entry. \"I saw three groups come right across in broad daylight,\" he said. \"One group walked across a man-made dam, got to a fence... they swing the gate wide open. It's not even locked.\" America floods the country with people who have no job skills and offer them a living on welfare. Voila, we have a work ethic breakdown.

I'm so sick of this true Christians who have never taken the Bible in their hands. reading or listening someone who read ancient texts and then declaring them to be applicable to today violates the scriptures.

Our thoughts and prayers go out to all of Amber's family and friends whom she clearly loved deeply. Trans woman murdered in Detroit. According to initial police reports, 20-yearold Amber Monroe was shot to death. A lot of transgendered women don't have support systems or employment. So they are forced to do whatever they can do to survive. This attack was fueled by transphobia and we do know that Amber's murder is the 12th murder of a transgender woman in the United States this year, and the 10th murder of a transgender woman of color. Transgender women, and especially transgender women of color, are disproportionately affected by violence. Her life was just beginning... I know that this loss will leave so many people with a hole in their lives and with more questions than answers. Let's work for real change so that our transgender sisters can be free from persecution. I know we can do better. We have to do better! ",

They accused her of misconduct for having an expired tube of toothpaste and for brushing food off the table. They placed her in a solitary confinement — a torturous, extremely distressing experience. The whole cruel, corrupted system is against her. It looks like military prosecutors view Manning in a way that means she must be \"broken\" or forcefully assimilated because of her crime —first, because she exposed the government's crimes, and government really doesn't like it, and second, because she's trans. Their goal is to see that Manning is as dehumanized as possible, but it's clear who the real non-humans are. Someone has gone to great lengths to paint Chelsea as a deceitful and psychotic character. But how many of those punishing Manning should themselves be in a psych ward? Transphobia is a one ugly thing. So sad when heroes like Chelsea Manning forced to suffer, to undergo injustice and humiliation, even though they had been through enough already!

And of course this world always need an amazing power of woman's touch:-) Isn't it just amazing? Wonder Woman presides over the wedding of two brides in Sensation Comics Featuring Wonder Woman, Chapter 48 written and illustrated by Jason Badower. Badower said he also really wanted to reference current affairs in the story specifically, legalization of same-sex marriage nationwide. \"I saw this Wonder Woman story as an incredible opportunity to have one of the most recognizable, iconic characters in the world to be among the first to step forward and officially endorse this new law,\" he said. \"I thought, let's not just have Wonder Woman embrace this new law, let's have her celebrate it.\" Some may ask — why is it so important when superheroes depicted as supporters of marriage equality? Because it is a massive, land-mark milestone in LBGTQ rights history. Because the fight to get to normal was so difficult, and because the fight to change normal is still ongoing. Just like Wonder Woman using her superpowers to struggle with violence and injustice of the world! :-) #wonderwoman #superheroes #marriageequality #gaymarriage #lesbian ",

Almost half of students are served in our program for English as a second language, so it will take years before some students master the language. Immigrants use every excuse why they can't learn: poverty, racism, too much homework, the list is endless. The main question is why do American taxpayers should pay and take responsibility to provide translators for folks who don't make an effort to learn and speak English? This is unfair that those kids whose parents chose to immigrate here (most illegally) are all on welfare. They know they don't have to work, because the government will take care of them. So, if the government continues to keep the same standards for illegal immigrants, America will become another 3rd world country. ",

The vast majority of these combat vets served in Afghanistan and Iraq. About 19,000 of them have been pending one month and five years and about 16,000 have been pending for more than five years. It is known that after five years vets lose their eligibility for free health care. Moreover approx. one-third of 847,000 vets with pending applications for health care had already died. Well, this story clearly demonstrates what value for the state the life of a man willing to sacrifice means. In fact the government doesn't care about its soldiers, even if they are heroes. This confirms that the government's slapdash attitude to the recording vets system left more than 35,000 veterans without medical assistance. And how many of them died before the error in the database was revealed! A truly disgusting attitude to our soldiers! ",

I bet you remember the white former officer who shot and killed an unarmed black teen in Ferguson, last August? After national debate over the relationship between police and black communities Darren Wilson aka \"Bad cop, who killed innocent black child\" tried to go back to police work but was turned down because he's too big a liability. In the recent interview to New Yorker magazine he said, \"It's too hot an issue, so it makes me unemployable.\" So what does the situation mean to America? Almost nothing except one thing... a man's life may be ruined because he had the audacity to defend himself against huge man with malicious intent. Michael Brown was a thug, who had just assaulted a store owner, and robbed him. Do you have any idea what should police officer do in such situation? He must stop the criminal, period. He was in a no-win situation and it proves how upside-down society has become. I wonder, what will be the next step of American justice degradation? Will surgeons be fired for operate patients with knives? Will Supreme Court send teachers to jail for teaching? Instead hate Wilson, we should pray for him. He did nothing wrong but idiots turned society against an innocent man. So is it a new America? ",

    "ad_copy": "Most parents aren't prepared for the words, \"Mom, Dad. I'm gay.\" For manyparents first reaction probably will be \"How will I ever handle this?\" The answer is simple and difficult at the same time: love and acceptance will help to understand your child's sexuality and its meaning to you and your continued relationship with your son or daughter. Some parents feel they would have been happier not knowing about their child's sexuality. They look back to before they knew and recall this time as problem-free - overlooking the distance they often felt from their child during that time. Sometimes parents try to deny what is happening - by rejecting what they're hearing (\"It's just a phase; you'll get over it\"); by shutting down (\"If you choose that lifestyle, I don't want to hear about it\"); or by not registering the impact of what we're being told (\"That's nice, dear, and what do you want for dinner?\"). Such denial often prove as a traumatizing experience for LGBT children. If you as a parent 'II pretend to forgot the truth about your child's sexuality, you would never really know your child. A large part of his or her life would be kept secret from you, and you would never really know the whole person. It is important to accept and understand your child's sexuality because homosexuality and bisexuality are not a phase. While people may experiment for some time with their sexuality, someone who has reached the point of telling a parent that he or she is gay is not usually going through \"a phase\". On the contrary, he or she has given long and hard thought to understanding and acknowledging his or her sexual orientation. So if you're wondering, \"Is she/he sure?\" the answer will almost always be \"yes\"! DON'T BE YOUR CHILD'S FIRST CLOSET! #children #lgbt #momdadimgay #gayisok #comingout #acceptance ",

Raynette Tumer who was the mother of eight children died in jail cell in police custody last week. She was arrested for shoplifting some crab legs from a grocery store. Due to her bad health history she was taken to the hospital and released. But she died in jail waiting for someone to help. According to American legislation, the courthouse officials are supposed to check the cell every fifteen minutes but, no one checked Tumer's cell for more than two hours. A total of five African-American women have been found dead in police custody in just the last month. Most of them were hold for minor charges and still their deaths are under investigation. Sandra Bland from Texas, Kindra Chapman from Alabama, Joyce Curnell from South Carolina, Ralkina Jones from Ohio, and Raynetta Turner from New York were found dead in their cell after being arrested by police officers. Once again it raises questions about how black people are treated in police custody. What if death in police custody is about excessive police force? Do you realize that dozens of black people were found dead in the U.S? ",

What the police ruled \"natural causes\" turned out to be that he starved to death. The crime? Shoplifting. Mitchell. who had a severe mental illness had been ruled permanently disabled and was unable to work. In April, he stole a zebra cake. a Snickers, and Mountain Dew from a local 7-11 in Portsmouth; Virginia. It would be a month before he ever went before a judge. A judge then ruled him incompetent to stand trial. He should have been transported to a local mental health facility, but he wasn't. Apparently there wasn't one that had room for him. Three months later he was found dead in his cell. No meds had ever been administered. He had never made it to a mental health facility. He had lost nearly 80 pounds because he refused to eat. All for less than $5 worth of snacks he stole while in a mental health crisis. Yes; you can die over 5 dollars here in America. Nothing new here. Justice is just an empty word in this country. Be sure, you will never know the truth. We are far away from the truth. ",

    "ad_copy": "Because They Lack Crucial Training, These Cops Severely Beat a BlindAutistic Teen Unconscious During the incident, Abrams, 17, suffered two seizures after police used force against him at the Green Line's Lexington Parkway Station. The teen suffers from Asperger's syndrome, which causes him to strongly dislike being touched or having people in his person space, and is considered legally blind, wearing extremely magnified glasses. Officers thought the non-compliance of Abrams was reason enough to justify forcibly taking him down, which resulted in him being battered and left unconscious. Abrams non-compliance wasn't done out of malice, but out of not really understanding the situation, and believing he hadn't done anything wrong. Abrams' autism makes it extremely difficult for him to interpret the intentions or feelings of others, according to his mother. Police released the teen to the custody of his mother rather than take him to the juvenile detention facility. Police are trained to think like the military in combat, which means they prioritize their own safety and the safety of fellow officers over everything else, including that of the citizens they allegedly \"protect and serve.\" ",

Rowan County Clerk Kim Davis will have to choose whether to issue marriage licenses, defying her Christian conviction, or continue to refuse them, defying a federal judge who could pummel her with fines or order that she be hauled off to jail. For Ms. Davis to enact her own personal policy is completely unacceptable. She is on her fourth marriage, a sinner according to her Bible, yet she's screaming about religious convictions. What a hypocrite! And she doesn't even perform the ceremony, only issue a license. What her religious convictions has to do with it?? It's not up to her to make policy, it's her role only to enact it! Funny how all these \"Christians\" are preaching and practicing all this hate, eh? If Jesus were around today, his response would be most likely, \"What the hell is wrong with you people!\" #SameSexMarriage #MarriageEquality #Kentucky #SCOTUS #homophobia #bigotry ",

But the gang of anarchist thugs declared war against the police. I can't belive it's possible. The police administer the law. Law-abidingness is an important part of American life. Of course, history knows police mistakes, but a mistaken arrest is very rare occurance. At the same time, don't forget that officers risk their lives every day. Americans have to honor sacrifices of policemen. Police officers significantly improve the quality of life for the citizens of their communities by keeping the peace despite sometimes overwhelming odds. America has to stand against radical activists who threaten not only officers lives, but also our security. ",

The tragedy of September 11th is still touching us. Some of us lost our family members or our friends, while others saw the terrorist attacks firsthand. R.I.P to all innocent victims, workers, police officers, firefighters and even dogs that died in this tragedy. This is a day in our history that everyone is going to remember. Today we should honor the memory of the killed ones and share our stories. What were you doing on 9/11? I'd like to tell you #My911 Story. I was only 15 when the attacks occurred. I was at school. I remember that somebody came and told us that there had been a serious bombing in NYC. We all said a prayer for the victims and went back to studies. But a few minutes later all students began receiving calls from their relatives. My mom called me crying. School was letting out early that day. When I came home I remember my dad watching the news and telling me that terrorists took responsibility for the attacks. And do you remember what you were doing on 9/11? #My911 Story ",

Alex Salinas was asked by his family to be godfather to his nephew, but the bishop of his local diocese on Spain's southern coast questioned his gender identity. Salinas was born a woman but has since undergone hormone therapy and has a male ID in Spain. He is now waiting for gender surgery. Bishop Rafael Zornoza Boy of Cadiz and Ceuta rejected the family's request to name Salinas as a godfather. Then, after a media storm, the bishop wrote to the Vatican for advice. Zornoza published the Vatican's reasoning for rejecting Salinas' wish. It said transsexual behavior \"reveals in a public way an attitude opposite to the moral imperative of solving the problem of sexual identity according to the truth of one's own sexuality.\" The pope supported gays, but now for some reason the transman wasn't allowed to be a godfather in Spain, an entirely Catholic, but at the same time, the most friendly country towards the LGBT community. Anyway it's just another superstition of Church. Funny. ",

The space warrior appears in Star Wars: Aftermath, which bridges the gap between Return of the Jedi and new film The Force Awakens. Sinjir, an Imperial turncoat who now serves in Luke Skywalker's Rebellion, is the first major gay role to be part of the Star Wars universe. He reveals his sexuality to female bounty hunter Jas Emari, who tries to chat him up. Chuck Wendig, author of Star Wars: Aftermath, said: \"I don't think his sexuality needs to be this giant plot point. At the same time, it's part of who he is. Isn't that great, guys? Ain't no lie, It's a big step forward. We want to thank the creators of the new \"Star Wars\" for the incredible courage and opposition to conservative bias in Hollywood cinema. There should be a special organization in Hollywood that will protect the rights of gay actors. There should be at least one gay character in every movie in order to help the American society get rid of homophobic stereotypes. ",

Had the situation been reversed, however, police officers would face neither criminal nor civil prosecution for declining to aid a citizen under assault by a suspect. A man named Devonte Conerly who was suspected in a hit and run incident, allegedly tried to disarm the police officer who stopped him. Several officers responded to a call for assistance and eventually subdued and handcuffed Conerly. They then rebuked several bystanders who had declined to intervene. Bystanders are not liable to prosecution if the failure to render aid \"was reasonable under the circumstances,\" but the burden of demonstrating that this is the case is placed upon the accused. When you'll see a bunch of cops beating an unarmed man, don't forget that you can be in his place just for not helping cops in committing a crime. ",

They were young and Black- that was enough for police officers to decide that they looked suspicious. The police brutality has sparked the movement and has emerged to demand justice and political attention. However, the everyday racism we see was not understood, but ignored. Moreover, the government along with the law enforcement violate our rights through the illegal use of force and mass arrests in order to obstruct our free expression. Yes, standing up for your right to protest for the equality and justice is challenging, but it's worth discrimination and unfairness black civilians face everyday. Remember, knowing your rights can be the most powerful weapon you have against police abuse and brutality. The most famous civil rights activists represent a basic philosophy, known for their fight against injustice and lasting profound impact in the lives of AfricanAmericans. Martin Luther King Jr., Malcolm X, Mary McLeod Bethune, Rosa Parks changed our lives forever. But what changes have you made? Have you contributed to a greater equality? What are you doing to fight against injustice and racism? Have you ever protested in civil rights protests or have you ever been part of Black Lives Matter movement? How do your protect your right to free expression? Please comment below, what have YOU done to prove- BLACK LIVES MATTER? ",

    "ad_copy": "Barack Obama and his team have spent two months working to secure 41percent for Iran deal. And now they claim enourmous victory. Under the Constitution, treaties require the support of two-thirds of the Senate. The deal with Iran is a treaty in every respect — a legally binding longterm agreement between sovereign powers, in which hundreds of billions of dollars will flow and billions of dollars in nuclear materiel will be destroyed. Since this is a treaty and we have 100 senators, Obama should have been obliged to secure the backing of 67 senators, not 41. Obama knows he can never get Iran deal through the Congress. Americans voted for the GOP in 2014 to provide Republican majority in both the House of representatives and the Senate. It has to stop crazy ideas of Obama. But Obama is not stupid, he is very crafty politician. He succeded to change a subject to a vote — not of approval, like a treaty, but of disapproval. It would be treated like any piece of legislation. It would be voted on by the House and the Senate, and if they turned thumbs-down, he could then exercise his presidential veto. The Constitution requires a second vote by the two Houses of Congress to overturn such a veto — and in that case, the vote has to be by two-thirds. So, instead of 67 Senators having to support the deal to make it legal, 67 senators have to disapprove of it to render it null and void. It is enough 60 or more Senators to overturn a veto. But you remember, 41 Senators agree to support the deal. Thus, it may well be that for the first time in American history, a president will simply impose a treaty on the country without even the pretense of seeking and obtaining the advice and consent of the Congress. And how? With 42 percent. Barack Obama is very smart man, but he is not a patriot. He doesn't care about Americans. All what he cares is his outsized ambitions. ",

Of course, not all Americans have a gun, but criminals don't know who is unarmed. Liberals can say that guns increase crime rate. In fact, it is nonsense. Look at statistics: the most gun-friendly state is Wyoming, and it has low crime-rate. The states with high crime rate are states where there are many illegals as usual. So, liberal hysteria is just foolishness. Liberals find reasons of crimes in wrong places. The U.S. Constitution should be saved. Do you agree? ",

Since then the U.S. Constitution has been amended twenty-seven times. All of amendments are steps that made the United States the greatest country in the world. The U.S. Constitution is not only the law, it is the basis of the country. Every true patriot respects it. Unfortunately, last decade has become the time of nihilism. More and more people don't respect American law. More and more people come to the United States and some of them don't feel reverence for our Constitution. It goes without saying that illegals who already broke the immigration law and will violate the supreme law easily. But the worst thing is that the current president of the United States and some high-ranking officials also spit upon the Constitution. They call for ban the right to bear arms, a confederate flag (I think this flag reflects not slavery, but important part of American history) and some liberals ban even the Old Glory -- a school district in Tennessee has banned all flags and banners, including the U.S. flag -- and so on. The same regards the Iran deal. America has a hard time. And we have to save the U.S. Constitution. We have to do it in God's name! America has to be great again because we are one nation under God!

I march to fix a system that houses more black men in our prison system than there were black men enslaved in 1850. To fix a system that allows for local prosecutors to investigate their friends at the police department when there is an officer-involved shooting. To fix a system that has drug laws that disproportionately arrest black and brown people for using drugs when white people use at the same rate. To fix a system that has built a private industry off the backs of prisoners laboring for pennies. To fix a system that doesn't video record the actions of law enforcement at all times. To fix a system that criminalizes young women who are pimped and sexually trafficked before they even turn 18. To fix a system that does not collect any national data on incidents when police use excessive force or discharge their firearm. To fix a system that has incarcerated more people than any other nation in the world. To fix a system that has created a school to prison pipeline by harsher school discipline practices for young students of color. To fix a system of policing that targets communities of color by programs like \"Stop & Frisk\" or \"Broken Windows.\" This is why I march. This is why we all should march in order to build a better future for our kids. We should fight the institutional racism in the country. Like and share if you want to help the movement! ",

The shooting took place in classrooms in Snyder Hall. Law enforcement officials have identified Chris Harper Mercer as the man responsible for the mass shooting.He had four weapons on him - three handguns and one assault weapon. Also he was definitely ready to put up a fight, because he had body armor and stash of ammunition. One of the witnesses said that the gunman first asked about people's religions before he began firing. The hospital said that all victims were female between the ages of 18 and 34, and quoted a doctor who said that an \"army\" of doctors and nurses had volunteered to help. It's the 45th shooting at a school so far this year. Obama said that America is the only country on Earth that sees these kinds of mass shootings every few months. And he's right. People already got used to this. Isn't it time for some gun control yet? Some white supremacists say that the killer was mixed and he supported BLM. This information is not confirmed and is more likely to be fake. This dude is definitely not black. His parents are Caucasian. The fact it's been a few hours since the shooting and they haven't say what race he is means he's white. And honestly, word \"shooting\" isn't used correctly here. Can we call it terror? Oh, wait. White male though... #UCC #Oregon #shooting ",

They say racism rises among the police officers, but in fact it rises among radical groups. Only black activists say \"black lives matter\", forgetting the fact that justice is when all lives matter. Americans are not against blacks, Latinos, etc. But if somebody breaks the law, he should be punished despite of his color or religion. If somebody goes over the speed limit, he should be ticketed. If somebody breaks the immigration law, he should be deported. If somebody kills a man, he should be imprisoned. Given the fact that two Islamic extremists who were arrested one year ago in Ferguson belong to the Nation of Islam, I cannot believe in Farrakhan's benevolent intentions. This Million Man March looks like another liberal overture to black and Muslim communities. This is a bad idea, especially if we take into account the recent news about British jihadi who have published the address of the Navy Seal Robert O'Neill, the man who fatally shot Osama bin Laden, and called on American extremists to execute him. There is no problem, if whoever wants to live in the United States. But he should live here legally; he should not break the law. It's justice. ",

The Department will release drug offenders who received harsh sentences over the last three decades. Every third of them is illegal immigrant. Barack Obama has criticized overblown sentencing laws that \"disproportionately impact communities of color.\" But is it indeed a reason to release criminals? If Latinos commit crimes often than whites, it doesn't mean that some Latino criminals should escape penalty. ",

No, she like Obama should say they're socialists who want to set up tyranny. The Founding Fathers had enough brains for preventing the situation when dictators run the country. They decided that armed nation is able to overthrow a tyrant. Maybe is it a true reason why Hillary Clinton stands against the Second Amendment? ",

The widespread death, rising racism, mob attacks and police brutality on Blacks coupled with economic deprivation and stark poverty, requires that something must be immediately done to address and correct the condition. We should stop the violence and the killings and present ourselves as a united front before the Government of the United States of America. Fredrick Douglas said \" Power concedes nothing except by a demand\". Our demand of government must be backed by the power of our unity and love of the brotherhood. It's really important for all of us, brothers and sisters. Join the Movement! 10-10-15 Justice Or Else! ",

The goal was to \"disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations.\" Well, the intervention deprived al-Qaida of a sanctuary. But al-Qaida — even after its leader Osama bin Laden was killed by U.S. commandos — has spawned cells elsewhere and inspired other extremists in Syria and Iraq. And now ISIS is rising as the most powerful terrorist organisation in the world. So, the question is whether it's worth to risk the lives of thousands of American soldiers for the mission that hardly can be called successful? It seems that Obama should review his military strategy without delay.Join us! Veterans USA( @veterans GovSpending ",

Hours later, two terrorists died in a shootout with San Bernardino police. One shooter still at large. It is known that gunmen are Muslims. They are very religious and probably linked with ISIS. California shooting should become a lesson for the administration — accepting refugees from Syria threatens the National security. It's tragedy. Enemies of America attacked our people again. Unfortunately, today we have no strong leader who is courageous enough to conquer terrorism. Nevertheless, we will not allow terrorists to change our way of life. We will not allow them to restrict our freedoms. We express our sincere condolences to families of victims in California shooting.

    "ad_copy": "Congressional Republicans voted on Thursday to make it more difficult forrefugees from Syria and Iraq to come to the US as the fallout from last Friday's Isis terrorist attacks in Paris continues. In addition, more than half of the US's governors have said they will no longer provide placement for Syrian refugees, arguing that they pose too great a risk to national security. New Jersey governor and Republican presidential candidate Chris Christie has said his state will not take in any refugees — \"not even orphans under the age of five\". Louisiana governor Bobby Jindal has said he has directed state police to \"track\" the Syrian refugees in his state, something his state police have played down. GOP presidential hopefuls Ted Cruz and Jeb Bush have suggested the US government prioritize Christian refugees. Barack Obama has pledged to veto the legislation, and has condemned the anti-refugee comments as \"un-American\", but experts worry the backlash could have dangerous consequences if these claims go unchecked.  The stories you need to read, in one handy email Read more \"Sowing fear of refugees is exactly the kind of response groups like Isis are seeking,\" said lain Levine, deputy executive director for program at Human Rights Watch, on Thursday. \"Yes, governments need to bring order to refugee processing and weed out militant extremists, but now more than ever they also need to stand with people uprooted from their homes by ideologies of hatred and help them find real protection.\"  http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/19/syrian-refugees-in-americafact-from-fiction-congress Obama has condemned more than half of the US's governors as `un-American' for saying they will no longer provide placement for Syrian refugees.

Yet they always forget to underpin their empty words with facts. Not like all these SJWs, let's refer to racial discrimination in the army of Union. A black soldier was paid $10 a month with a $3 clothing fee taken out, while a white soldier was paid $13 a month but was not forced to pay a clothing allowance. Almost a twofold difference! How tolerant tho! And what was going on in the \"racist\" Confederate States Army? Every soldier was paid $11/month until 1864 regardless of his skin color.

If it was lawful to kill Quintonio LeGrier because he was in abnormal state of mind according to the cops, then we ask, how about the shooting of Bettie Jones? The story is always rewritten and painted when it comes to dealing with race. Racial disparity and segregation cannot be overlooked in America. There is too much level of inhumanity. The cops still things it wasn't enough killing a mentally disordered and an innocent woman. He still has the balls to sue even the dead. This is what living in America is like, if you are black. ",

But after just one season pitching for a Cardinals minor league team and performing solidly, Dunnington quit. He explains that during his playing days, he was a closeted gay man playing in an uncomfortable environment. A particular low point came when a coach made a bragging reference to the brutal murder in Wyoming of gay college student Matthew Shepard whose death led to federal hate crime legislation in the US. And the hate goes on and on and on....You need fight back! It's a shame all those \"big strong men\" are afraid of what somebody does in private!! ",

Matthew works at an orphanage built and run by an American citizen named Upendo Children Centre. The main aim of this orphanage was to assist abandoned children in Nairobi, Kenya. Upon Matthew's arrival in Kenya, he insisted on not staying in the apartment allocated to him by authorities but preferred to stay in the very dormitory where these children stayed. He also based his choice on being in a better position to assist the children should the need arise. Mathew raped three teenagers — ages of 5, 9, and 15 respectively for not less than 8 times. He also maltreated a 12 year old boy. This outrageous act led to his sentence of 40 years imprisonment and a fined of $15, 863. ",

Most people are jailed because one way or the other there was no money to do what was necessary at a particular time even though they were innocent. Prosecutors have developed this platform as a gold mine, extracting huge sum of money from civilians. You can be put behind bars if you fail to comply with the demands. Suddenly one's life becomes tattered when jail comes in, because there is no freedom of making a better living. Federal prosecutors should shake up and hold judges and all these people who take advantages of people by making them pay huge sums of money or put someone behind bars because he/she couldn't pay a fine.

The filming was still in process as he commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him and shot the mentality ill man too.

In an America where the Republican political party had a 44% very unfavorable view of Islam, despite 78% of the same Republican respondents saying they neither worked with nor had any Muslim friends. according to a YouGov poll conducted from 6 -9 March, 2015. In an America where failed businessman and top contender for the GOP nomination Donald Trump has publicly and unapologetically called for widespread surveillance on mosques, mass deportations, denial of asylum to all Muslims and has lauded a plan to shoot Muslims with bullets covered in pigs blood. So when Bernie Sanders acts like a human being and commits his prospective presidency (not to mention entire career) to combatting racism, xenophobia and Islamophobia, it shouldn't come as a surprise to anyone that Muslim Americans overwhelmingly support his bid for the White House.

Authorities are reviewing surveillance video of the reported attack, which occurred shortly after 3 a.m. Saturday at the Kwik Shop at 4820 E. 21 st St. That's just northeast of the Wichita State University campus. One of the victims was Khondonkor Usama, Muslim 23, the second victim, is a 19-year-old student who has chosen to remain anonymous. They were getting gas and snacks at about 3 a.m. Saturday when they noticed a man shouting at someone who had apparently asked him for gas money. When the suspect began using racial slurs against the man who asked him for money, one of the students attempted to intervene. The attacker then turned his wrath on the two students, stopping his motorcycle in front of Usama's car and approaching Usama's friend, who had gotten out of the car. The suspect called his friend \"brown trash\" and told him he had to \"leave this country,\" According to Usama's account, his friend responded: \"This is my country. Who the hell are you to tell me to leave?\" The incident \"escalated really quick,\" with the suspect attempting to punch his friend, Usama said. When he attempted to break up the fight, Usama said he was assaulted and knocked down. He called 911, and as he was on the phone the attacker rode circles around the two students, chanting \"Trump! Trump! Trump!\" and screaming, \"We'll make America great again! We'll throw you out of the wall!\" ",

We know that you defend American Muslims now in your presidential campaign, but did you support us before campaign? We didn't forget who supported the war in Iraq, we are Muslims and Americans, so we know your support to invade Iraq in 2003 have caused hundreds of American soldiers to die hundreds of miles away from their homes, and also millions of Iraqi Muslims, including innocent men, women and children, to die in their homes, and for what? Libya! You supported bombing and destroying the whole country just to kill AIGaddafi. You said in an interview: \"We came, we saw, he died\". Let's not forget about Benghazi, where you declined to increase the embassy security, and that caused the death of the U.S. Ambassador J. Christopher Stevens and U.S. Foreign Service Information Management Officer Sean Smith and CIA contractors Tyrone S. Woods and Glen Doherty and Ten others were also injured in the attacks. You killed Saddam Hussein and AI-Gaddafi in Iraq and Lybia leaving the countries there in chaos, which led to the birth of ISIS, which is now a threat not only to the U.S. but the whole world! You are supporting gun control, disarming the American citizens and at the same time selling weapons to groups in the Middle East to fight their leaders, creating on the short run terrorist groups as we saw in Libya, Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. 8 years ago you were against refugees, but now you support them. 10 years ago you were against same sex marriage, but now you support it. You change your views very fast. You speak as a democrat and act as a republican. Sorry, but you can not be our representer, you can not be the president of the United States. Sincerely, United Muslims of America ",

Authorities claim they coaxed Larry to a house with a 911 call, and then detonated a homemade bomb that killed him. He was the seventh-longest-serving inmate in Nebraska. Subsequent paroles and retrials were denied for these two men. Langa was in prison for 45 years. Details of the cause of his death are still unknown.

He took a gun and ordered his other two brothers to take a video of the whole incident. Michael Ford, at the police vicinity opened fire and got the cop's attention. The filming was still in process as he commanded. The first cops who appeared fired back and almost immediately ended up drawing fire. He gave the other officer a chance to get into position when he opened fire. It's quite not understandable why his own cop shot him and shot the mentality ill man too. This is a good example of sick reality too. Is there any explanation why cops have started shooting each other?

Alabama happens to be one of the nation's poorest states which have led to overcrowd in its prison.

Four other larger prisons will be built additionally to prevent the rate of overcrowd. Even though one would have taught of using this money for projects like health care facilities and other, he chose prisons. It's not bad though, at least inmates will have free live behind bars.

Suddenly, officers approached him and began asking him out of the premises. Apparently he had not committed any crime or violated any order, so he was disturbed and begun to argue with them. Seriously this guy was detained for useless reasons. This is what American police find interest in — unnecessary and useless way of harassing blacks. Very ridiculous.

She said there is \"a special place in hell\" for people like Hillary \"and I hope she enjoys it there\". Smith added in her interview: \"I want Hillary to talk to me personally, and tell me why there was no security there, when they were asked for it. I know this, because I spoke to my son. That day, he says he was really scared, because he saw the 17 people — 17 November, whatever it was, that they were walking around taking pictures. And he was afraid. He says it didn't look very good. And he was afraid. And that he asked for security, and he was turned down.\" This must be a mean joke we're having that kind of liar as a possible president. Even understanding that most liberals are brainwashed I just don't get it - how can a politician caught in a lie of that scale still be trusted by electorate? One must be totally insane to follow THAT kind of leader. Patricia's son is an American hero and his blood is on Hillary's hands. ",

The journalists are trying to depict Trump as a racist and continue their attempts even after Trump officially declared \"I don't know anything about David Duke... You're asking me a question that I'm supposed to be talking people I know nothing about.\" However, \"for some reasons\" the same mass media in their revelation campaign forgot to mention Hillary Clinton's ties to Robert Byrd, a former KKK leader. Hillary described him as a man of \"surpassing eloquence and nobility\". In 2010 after Byrd died she released a tribute video saying \"It is almost impossible to imagine the United States Senate without Robert Byrd. He was not just its longest-serving member; he was its heart, its soul, and its historian. From my first day in the Senate, I sought out his guidance, and he was always generous with his time and his wisdom. I admired his tireless advocacy for his West Virginia constituents, his fierce defense of the Constitution, and the traditions of the Senate, and his passion for a government that improves the lives of the people it serves.\" So here the mass media give us an political paradox: a Republican candidate can't be endorsed by a former KKK member, but a Democrat can easily show her respect and honor to a former racist leader without being judged for that. Isn't that a little hypocritical? ",

During the debate on 8th March she was asked about deportation. Clinton said: \"I would not deport children. I do not want to deport family members either. I want to, as I said, prioritize who would be deported: violent criminals, people planning terrorist attacks, anybody who threatens us. That's a relatively small universe.\" Oh wonderful, so she admits she wants to be the second Obama, like the first one isn't enough. And we know what's behind this world \"children\" — young men who claim to be less than 18. Same way the \"illegals without a criminal record\" is also those who are not proved to be criminals yet. Crossing the U.S. border without permission is already a crime. A crime that should bring just one simple punishment — deportation and a prohibition of further entrance. We do not need a president who doesn't understand that. We do not need a president who forgives this kind of crime. We do not need Hillary. ",

THINGSHAVE BEEN VERY SILENT ON HIS BEHALF The 31-year-old black man died Feb. 20 at Fairfield Medical center after he had a °medical episode' at the jail when deputies were moving Ariel J. Clark from one cell to another. According to police reports; Ariel J. Clark, 31 was too combative with officers and was threatening to kill them during his arrest. On February 17, a motorist called 911 after interacting with Clark; reporting that Clark, who was driving his wife and two children from Buffulo to Texas, was threatening to kill him and his son. Clark's wife said that a man and his son began to argue with her husband, who had been acting wierd because he hadn't slept in five days. When the police arrived. Clark was arrested, taken to the Fairfield County Jail where he was placed in a restraint chair for his combative behavior. Three days after arriving in jail, Clark had some breathing difficulties and deputies started chest compression. But an hour later he was pronounced dead at a local hospital. An investigation has been opened after the death of a Fairfield County Jail inmate. Now the question is whether the jail's standard operating procedures were followed. We would like to see a true picture of what he looked like after \"fighting\" with the police. Also, we would like to see the picture of him when he arrived at hospital. For now the only thing we know is that another black man died in police custody. ",

She gets hundreds of flirty messages every day and she laughs at the idea that changes someone's sexuality. Roby Rose thinks that it's not possible to change someone's sexuality because it's something you're born with and it's not changeable. I agree with her! Unfortunately, bigots like to say that homosexuality is a choice, so it can be \"cured\". Just like Ben Carson thinks that you're choosing to be gay and the prison is the proof of that. These ideas lead to thousands of broken lives. Why is it so hard to accept the fact that we were born this way?! ",

He was charged with involuntary manslaughter and two lesser charges in her death, but the case was dropped in January 2015. Justice hasn't been served for Aiyana and her grieving family. We're planning a peaceful rally in front of the Coleman A. Young Municipal Center on May 21 to honor the memory of Aiyana and other victims of police violence and demand demilitarization of police. We should draw as much attention as possible to the lack of justice for the families of those who lost their beloved ones at the hands of the police. Invite everyone you know and join us on May 21.

For example, Wisconsin suspended 26.6 percent of Black students compared to the 3 percent of white students. Also in Minnesota, Connecticut, Iowa and Nebraska black students were six times more likely than white students to be suspended from school. The racism in education is the reason why the school-to-prison pipeline exists. Our kids cannot even get a proper education, no wonder the success rate among black students is low. Somehow white people still think that education is only their privilege. ",

It's another prove that if you are black in this country; you are never safe. You can be arrested killed or imprison literally for the color of your skin. Walker's attorney said that Walker can obtain up to $170,000 for the time he spent in prison, but is it a good price for the 10 years of his life?!

It started in North Carolina but it can spread all over the country. Blacks are being deprived of general voting rights. The U.S. District Judge, Thomas Schroeder, on Monday dismissed lawsuits challenging changes to the state's election laws, declaring that the challenges failed to show that it hindered voters of color from exercising their voting rights. The North Carolina law which eliminated early voting, same —day voter registration and out-of-precinct voting requires voters who go to the polls to show an acceptable form of identification such as a driver's license, passport or military ID. This is not a good sign as we watch the world take the new turn for the worse now while doing nothing.

Of course, the highest incarceration level is among the black population of the country. The system is enslaving us with the help of the jails and it affects the whole community.

According to State Police troopers Darzeil Hall and Lamarr Johnson, ever since they returned to work; they have been subjected to petty attacks and denied attempts in promotion. Instead of correcting the wrong behavior toward black employees, police department aggressively criticized their conduct. For instance, police trooper Hall received a \"need improvement rating,\" his squad car was taken away, and his gym car was deactivated for a minor mistake. Along with Hall,. police trooper Johnson was denied at least five promotions after the lawsuit ended on the basis of race. Once again the race car is alive and well. Unfortunately; black police officers still remain second-class officers and experience unfair treatment in police department despite the fact that we live in a \"post-racial' society. ",

Dawud Abdulwali attended a party in a Hollywood hotel where he ranted about the August 2014 killing of unarmed Michael Brown by a white police officer in Ferguson. According to one of the witnesses; he was so mad about the high profile killing of unarmed black men, so he burned the building. Abdulwalia's anger at police was not a good reason to burn down some apartments, but injustice brought him to this action. Either way, crime should not be tolerated. But we have to start thinking about the message he was trying to send: having a black president changes almost nothing. ",

Catherine Brown. Brown was driving back home; when MorsiMurphy jumped out of the car and approached her yelling curse words and demanding she move the vehicle back. When Brown reached for her license; Lopez pointed a gun at her head. Moreover, Lopez WAS LAUGHTING at poor Brown; who was beat and pepper-sprayed by police. Brown is not the only victim, her kids had suffered from pepper spray too. The US police is just insane. What's the problem with peaceful arrest? Why the hell they treat us as animals? This will not stop until cops are held personally and financially responsible for their actions. Could you imagine, if soldiers acted like this towards civilians in a combat zone? 100% it would be treated as a war crime. So why do we have another attitude to people in blue? ",

Notice the location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on the passenger's side. When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man briefly lying unconscious on the ground. The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys? Damn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO POLICE! The following video is a prime example of why... ",

I didn't notice in the video the suspect spitting at Dickson. However; the police department didn't consider it necessary to punish the cop. The only penalty he got was a suspension without pay for 1 day. Is it really enough for excessive force use? ",

Good cops keep silence, huh? Such incidents can't happen again, we need to get cops that can't handle their tempers off of the streets. Guys, what do you think about it?

From time to time we receive messages like \"why you do not talk about good cops?\" Well, I guess it's time to answer the question... As the nation has been torn apart by police violence and abuse, we have begun to wonder whether there are any good cops at all. Do they exist? Where are these legendary \"good cops\"? Sad, but according to our research good cops are threatened with extinction. After sleepless nights with coffee and YouTube search we finally found a great example of a GOOD COP. Please welcome - Mr. Right Officer, who comes to the suspect's aid, not once, not twice, but at least three times physically stopping the arresting officer from abusing the suspect. If you think that all cops SHOULD take a stand like this, then help us SPREAD THE WORD! ",

I wonder, why is no one talking about black women abused by police? At the time when Americans' attention focuses primarily on the relationship between black men and law enforcement, we've got to admit the fact that Black women have a tough time too. To my mind it should come to national spotlight; from teen girl, who was slammed to the floor in a South Carolina classroom to the mysterious death of Sandra Bland in a jail cell. We want to give you a chance to express yourself and share your minds with us. WATCH the video below, showing black women bringing their problems to the forefront. ",

They believe they are judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law, it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot someone who is not a threat simply because that person \"deserves it\" in their eyes. It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will get away with it. In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand that their job is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you, they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job. Bad that America trained not like this!??? ",

Approximately 30,000 Marine Reservists may have suffered the same kind of exposure. Where were the liberals shouting about ecological problems? Why do they care about shutting down the coal industry to avoid mysterious unproved global warming but they don't mind thousands of Americans drinking poisoned water? Neither the VA officials nor our military commanders helped our Marines and now they just feel abandoned. Bob Miranda-Boulay said `I don't count' — that is what our veterans feel. That is not an attitude they deserve. \"I wanted to make a difference,\" Boulay said. \"I love my country and I wanted to do the right thing. I wanted to be a Marine.\" That is a real shame our veterans feel being betrayed by our country leaders. ",

Hospital staff and Roberto's family arranged his final meeting with two horses. Gonzalez was paralyzed in Vietnam during his service. He gave his health away in the name of America like thousands of our brave soldiers did. Unfortunately no one can return their health and lives back. Our best people have to live the shortest lives. If only our Government could pay more attention to our heroes' problems to make them a bit happier and to make their heroic lives a bit longer. ",

Retired marine Frank Larison recently received a letter by the HOA, ordering him to remove his \"marine stickers\" from his Chevy car. Frank and his lawyer claim that he will face $50 a day if he refuses to do so. If he does not play those fines, he will be towed. Have you ever heard of someone receiving a notification to remove Obama stickers? LGBT stickers? Those terrorists Black Lives Matter stickers? Well, me neither! The liberal rage comes only to those who love the Old Glory or U.S. Armed Forces. Our whole society is ill. Libtards are allowed to do whatever they want while even the smallest demonstration of love and devotion to America causes an immediate intervention from the authorities. ",

As if that weren't enough, the proposal also demands another $2.1 billion for refugees. This just says it all. Again and again he ignores the needs of American citizens, but has no problem taking their hard earned money just give it to people who deserve it the least. I guess Veterans don't need a better social security. Thank you Obama for betraying America. ",

First of all, Benghazi: four people died on her watch and she did not send help. Secondly, Hillary refused to apologize to all veterans, when she has made several remarks about veterans \"embellishing\" the situation at the VA. Finally, Hillary is the only one politician (except Barack Obama) who is despised by the overwhelming majority of American veterans. If Hillary becomes the President of the US, the American army should be withdrawn from Hillary's control according to the amendments to the Constitution. ",

The board approved Russell Lee at the request of the school's Campus Advisory Council. So, what can I say? This is a disgrace for the Texas authorities! I am shocked at the dismantling of southern history. We know that our ancestors fought for our freedom. These names were, are and always will be the part of Texas history. Why is Texas administration willing to do anything what feds say them? Isn't it obvious that the Federal government aims to destroy our history? This is a madness! Therefore, I need to ask you: are you ready to defend our Heritage? The Southern history needs protection now more than ever before! ",

The Methodist Episcopal Church have decided that the families will have to divide $1.5 million in donations, while they will keep $1.8 million; with plans to make long-needed repairs to the church. For instance, the wife of the Rev. Clementa Pinckney who was among those killed by white shooter Dylan Roof, has not received any of the donation proceeds. Nothing will bring the victims of Charleston massacre back, but this money will help aid in bridging the gap in the loss of an income. Donations are important for these families since they did not receive a cent from the government. ",

Man; there were so many ways to fix the situation without resorting to use excessive force. The worst part of it is how everyone just stands around nonchalantly.? People who support cops and belive in good cops, please tell me why the hell a bunch of cops just stand and watch how another cop beating a woman??? How??? How can we respect law enforcement, if they act like that? If you want my respect, STOP SHOOTING AND BEATING THE CITIZENS YOU SWORE TO PROTECTT. ? IF U AGREE ",

Jail officers said Bethea had threatened them and that's why he was hit with a stun gun but I guess cops didn't know the camera was recording them. FIVE OFFICERS stood over Bethea and just watching how Clark pulled the trigger two more times. As usual, no charges were ever filed against the officers involved in Bethea's death. There is no doubt that Bethea was murdered. Have you noticed that it took 20 minutes passed by before another officer summoned a nurse and they attempted to revive Bethea. All of bastard cops who were there should be in prison for murder. America, it's not a black or white problem... but a blue one. ",

    "ad_copy": "SHOCKING!!! Cops can't stop using their blue privilege for illegal parking.Could you imagine how off-duty deputy Tracy Weiss was shocked when she realized that her budge won't protect her from paying parking fines? Her face is priceless. The story happened last month when Weiss found her car being towed for illegal parking. The cop jumped into another vehicle to block the driver, who had towed her car. When she exited the vehicle she had her gun drawn. The driver started recording the incident when he understood that his life is under threat. That's how $62.50 fine turned into $125. The sheriff's office said Weiss has been an Orange County deputy for 11 years and they are investigating the incident. I have only one question: is that how PD trains police in our country? For 11 years she should know how to fix the situation like that. The only reason she should identify herself as an officer is to explain why she has a holstered weapon. Aside from that she should not have mentioned it nor should she have drawn the weapon. To my mind, this woman need to stop being a deputy and carrying a gun. Such cops and people as well should stay away from guns. This would give our citizens a chance to get back home alive. For more stories, join our new brand site http://donotshoot.us/ ",

I wonder how Hillary can even have military supporters, our soldiers have suffered enough from the liberal-in-chief for the last eight years. What's also confusing in that poll — almost every fifth polled soldier refuses to vote at all. It's a great demonstration out troops no longer trust the President, and Clinton would definitely not change the situation. No need to remind you what mistakes can Hillary do if allowed running our military forces —we don't need another Iraq and we definitely don't need another Benghazi. ",

It happened in May 2015 and luckily had a happy end, as a result the students were allowed to attach our flag to their vehicles. The story ended well by efforts of dozens of patriots united to protest against High School authorities. It was a peaceful but strong and confident protest that made the authorities listen, it was a great example of how conscious people should act. We have to keep ready to stand against all kinds of attacks on American values and Constitutional laws. Unfortunately our current Government approves and even provokes these attacks, and the liberals' offensive and violent moods make it clear — every American patriot has to be careful and attentive. ",

Cooke is a law student, so she knows her rights. When she refused to consent to search, she was told to wait for a K-9 unit to arrive before she could leave. Cooke didn't commit any crime, that's why she wanted to leave, but officers had the different plans. She was thrown to the ground by the male agent and the female agent deployed the taser. After she screamed from the pain for several seconds, she was handcuffed, while agents illegally opened her truck and searched it. Of course, they found nothing. She spent over an hour in handcuffs and then about 4 hours in the US customs Station in Ogdensburg before she could go home. This girl's day was totally ruined because cops thought that she looked suspicious. After they ILLEGALLY searched her vehicle, she couldn't go. This is what real terrorism looks like! ",

Another cop was caught lying about the case. It's not the first video that proves that cops are lying bastards and it's not the last.

    "ad_copy": "Illegal immigrant invasion is going at full speed and drug cartels are their mostpowerful weapon. Recently a huge drug cartel operation was discovered in North Carolina. Over the course of the investigation, authorities seized six pounds of crystal meth, eight pounds of marijuana, 49.3 grams of heroin, four handguns and $2.5 million in cash, according to a press release. \"It would be safe to say that the money would be taken back to Mexico, and that's where the source of the cocaine was,\" special agent Tim Stone said. This is good news, but sadly this operation is just one of the thousands, which makes it just a slap on the wrist. Our traitor government does nothing to prevent drug influx, but only trying to create the presence of an effort. The most part of this poison comes through southern border, but it is still as unprotected as it possibly can be and drug cartels are abusing it as much as they can. At the expense of our tax dollars and lives of our youth, our government officials continue to make some kinds of vile deals with drug cartels to get filthy rich and gain more control over weaken nation. Only a huge wall with gun towers will stop this invasion. Trump is our only hope for a better future! ",

So, Bernie has the point. I appreciate the way he maintains his independent opinion in spite of all the pressure that is on him as the \"second Democratic option\". Because that is a fact. The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than an \"organized crime\" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers' money! Hillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that abuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged feminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries that prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary has always been a \"defender\" of the minorities. So, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me. What's your opinion on that point? ",

The lawsuit filed Friday says House Bill 1523 violates the separation of church and state by favoring \"certain narrow religious beliefs that condemn same-sex couples who get married, condemn unmarried people who have sexual relations and condemn transgender people.\" How many times do we have to do this? Your BELIEFS don't supersede my RIGHTS!! You just want to use your religious beliefs as an excuse to deliberately harm others and have no consequences for doing so!

    "ad_copy": "All people have to understand that the police service is exactly like a secretgay club, the reason being that no one knows what goes on inside there even if it's evident. There's a kind of code of silence, even if you saw something or just know something about other police officer, you keep silence about it. But if you are in a member of a club, you can be sure that no one will ever let your secrets out. Statistically, 46% of cops admit to witnessing misconduct by other cops! Also, 73 % of the individuals pressuring officers to keep quiet about the misconduct are leaders. 8% of the officers who admitted to intentionally withholding the information about officer misconduct were upper administrators. Cops will always lie to suit interaction or conversation. Sadly enough,\"Sworn officer of the court\" is most likely to lie than the citizen he is even accusing. So, the lie is a norm for the officers who are keeping the code of silence, and it's a miracle if a police officer tells the truth.

Rep. Grace Meng (D-N.Y.) sponsored the bill, which aimed to \"modernize\" two references to \"Orientals\" and \"Negros\" in the U.S. Code that date to the 1970's. The words will be replaced with \"Asian Americans\" and \"African Americans,\" respectively. \"The term `Oriental' has no place in federal law and at long last this insulting and outdated term will be gone for good,\" Meng said in a statement on Friday. Obama signed the bill shortly before leaving for his trip to Vietnam and Japan, where he will become the first sitting U.S. president to visit Hiroshima.

These videos and instances have become so common that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now, karma's coming back for blue pigs! A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two officers for seemingly no reason. The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you \"doing their job.\" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our ancestors did it for centuries. Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change. Amen. ",

Americans have rights and one of them is the right to remain silent. We don't have to answer your stupid interrogation questions. If we are speeding, tell us we were stopped for speeding, issue the warning/summons and get the hell out of our lives Nazis. Why did they escalate the situation? What for? The best part of the video is when they say she had the right to remain silent. LOL!#Copslogic ",

    "ad_copy": "Please take a moment to read my story!Back in 2015, Douglas Babbitt was talking on the phone in the driver's seat of his parked van when a police officer asked if an open beer bottle on the ground near the vehicle's front passenger door belonged to him. Notice the location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on the passenger's side. When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man briefly lying unconscious on the ground. The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys? Damn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO POLICE! The following video is a prime example of why... ",

In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense altercation with a student. According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim, Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom. The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him. I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not destruction of evidence a crime? What do you think about it guys? Please, share or comment below. ",

In the world of sports, Muhammad Ali will forever be known as the boxing legend who won 56 bouts over the period of a 21-year career. In popular culture, he will be remembered as the man who was not afraid when it came to speaking his mind -- someone who was not shy of talking about things unrelated to boxing, and would always take the right stand when needed. He risked his career and reputation by opposing the US-Vietnam War. Furthermore, he refused to serve in the US Army and in the process, was accused of committing a felony. Now that he is gone, this world is left with memories, and a void that cannot be filled. May Allah rest his soul in peace and paradise!!! ",

Mexican cartels have a stable stream of drugs through the border and our government does nothing with it. To cure our nation we need to get rid of all the gangs and illegal immigrants and build a huge wall so they would never come back! ",

At the request of rapper Killer Mike, over 8,000 people have transferred their money into Black-owned banks in the last 5 days. 50 years ago Martin Luther King Jr. requested Blacks to replace their funds from non-Black banks to Black-owned institutions which would help to empower and advance Black community.

It was a peaceful protest against the police shootings of Alton Sterling in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and Philando Castile in Falcon Heights, Minnesota. So he turned this peaceful protest into a scene of chaos and carnage. The wounded include seven police officers and two civilians. The sniper, Micah X. Johnson was a black U.S. military veteran of the Afghan war. As he was captured, he claimed he wanted to \"kill white people\". There's no evidence that he was a Black Lives Matters activist. There's no proof that he was into the movement anyhow. It happened almost a week ago and the police can't show anything to prove there was a link between Micah X. Johnson and Black Lives matter. But the Main stream media are telling us time and again that «black lives matter terrorists are killing the police officers». The main stream Media are telling us, that the protest against police terror is a violent anti-government riot!

In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense altercation with a student. According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim, Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom. The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him. I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not destruction of evidence a crime? What do you think about it guys? Please, share or comment below. ",

We're hiding behind political correctness and denying the truth because we don't want to `offend' someone. And the truth is: a group of people calling their supporters to commit violence is not a peaceful group. A group of people coming to their opponent's rallies and attacking peaceful people is a group of extremists. A group of people standing behind the attack on police is a group of terrorists. The Black Lives Matter are terrorists, and the sooner we admit it officially — the sooner this war on cops will end and people running a conservative rally won't be afraid to be attacked by a hateful gang.

The Clinton Foundation is nothing more than an \"organized crime\" at it's finest, in which we are investing our taxpayers' money! Hillary has no problem in accepting foreign money from the countries, like Saudi Arabia. Hillary has no remorse about taking money from countries that abuse the rights of women, while she has always had her own alleged feminist stance. She does not refrain from receiving money from the countries that prosecute, torture and execute LGBT on the legal basis, although Hillary has always been a \"defender\" of the minorities. So, why are so many people going to vote for her? That's a secret for me. What's your opinion on that point? ",

    "ad_copy": "Everyday we watch, read and receive news of police beating, assaulting, andkilling innocent people. These videos and instances have become so common that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now, karma's coming back for blue pigs! A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two officers for seemingly no reason. The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you \"doing their job.\" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our ancestors did it for centuries. Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change. Amen. ",

Notice the location of the beer can - it's located on the ground, outside of the vehicle, on the passenger's side. When Babbitt said the beer wasn't his, the police needlessly escalated the situation that lead to Babbitt's arrest, and left the 51-year-old Oakland man briefly lying unconscious on the ground. The beer wasn't in his car, and a toxicology report from after his arrest shows that he had no alcohol in his system. So what's the problem with you guys? Damn, after all that, the only thing I may conclude is DO NOT TALK TO POLICE! The following video is a prime example of why... ",

Another arrest was carried out the following day, during the morning hours where 23 protestors were arrested and charged with public nuisance and unlawful assembly. Since July 7, the day after which Castile was fatally shot to death, sympathizers have been embarking on demonstration outside the governor's home but police officers are asking the protesters out of the premises because they are blocking the streets. This request seemed not successful, therefore the protesters stood against the officers. According to the governor, the protestors are welcomed to stay because he had no problem with them being there. Even though the street was cleared few days after July 18, some protesters have returned to the premises to continue the demonstration.

This is a real proof that white officers will just kill blacks and still walk without prosecution. This is the reason why they are not scared of taking a black person's life. Fortunately he has lost an appeal to get his job back — for the second time, but what I find really interesting is the reason why he was fired. It is now absolutely clear that Police Chief fired Manney for his actions that led to the shooting, but not for the shooting itself.

President Obama was elected for a reason. He was the stepping stone for blacks to rise but it was blown away. Now, it is the time of White America to rebuild and advance and make their race great. The war for power between blacks and whites is very real, but the black community has forgotten. Consequently, the power of black is fading day by day because those in position are descending from the ladder every day. In no time; \"White Power' will be stronger than before.

The incident unfolded in December 2012 after Martinez, a 10-year veteran trooper, took chase when 25-year-old Steven Gaydos ran a stop sign near Houston. Apparently this Texas deputy wanted to go back to the good old days and show off his fancy moves by jumping in the air and kicking this guy who was already surrendering off his motorcycle. Wow, bad cops with Rambo mentality issues should be dismissed and forbidden from ever owning any firearm again. period! ",

They believe they are judge, jury and executioner, and if someone disobeys them or breaks the law, it is their job to punish that person. They believe it is justifiable to shoot someone who is not a threat simply because that person \"deserves it\" in their eyes. It will be hard to find the same approach in any other country. So what's the difference? The difference in mindset, American cops truly believe they will get away with it. In comparison with other countries, particularly in the UK, cops understand that their job is to apprehend, NOT PUNISH. They do not try to shoot you, they understand that they are not the jury and this is not their job. Bad that America trained not like this!??? ",

The establishment thinks they can treat us like stupid sheep but they are wrong. We won't put up with this anymore. The corrupt media does not talk about the crimes committed by Killary Rotten Clinton, neither does it mention the leaked emails but it would rather keep on kicking around some outdated tapes featuring Trump. Even Republicans are now offering her a victory by renouncing their nominee. What is this if not treason? No, no, no. We are free citizens of Texas and we've had enough of this cheap show on the screen. We're ready to prove our commitment to liberty, low taxes and gun rights. If Trump wins, there will be a possibility to secede peacefully but not without tension. What will happen if Hitlery becomes President? Higher taxes to feed undocumented aliens. More refugees, mosques, and terrorist attacks. Banned guns. Continuing economic depression. Let's remind them what Texas is made of and show that we're ready to SECEDE! Use our page to team up with other locals. Invite your friends and family, spread the word and let's make this effort together! Get Ready to Secede! ",

And here are some real Clinton decisions: —Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had been exaggerated by Republicans. —In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007 supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans' medical care. -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20 million for veterans' health care facilities. -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.\" In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad! Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her! ",

    "ad_copy": "Boston police shot and killed a man wearing body armor and wielding anassault rifle who critically injured two officers responding to a domestic disturbance call late Wednesday, according to Police Commissioner William Evans. A gun battle raged at an East Boston home as a suspect, Kirk Figueroa, 33, of East Boston, critically injured two Boston police officers late on October 12.He was then shot and killed by other officers who ran into the home to drag out their wounded colleagues while undergoing heavy gunfire themselves. This bloody massacre is a vivid example of the fact that the war with police is too far from being OVER. It's only coming and the consequences will be destructive if Hillary Clinton, the main hardliner against cops, will become the President of the United States. Defending the police against liberal and racist accusations is a solemn duty of every American Patriot. Recent spate of cop killings indicates that American national identity is undermined and replaced by ridiculous social experiments liberal elites are constantly setting up on the country. Democrats are unable to secure the police from attacks of extremist movements like Black Lives Matter. The Nation must unite against reverse racism, against those who want to destroy America! Among all the candidates Donald Trump is the one and only who can defend the police from terrorists. ",

After the concerned parent posted a disturbing video showing teacher manhandling a small child on Facebook, the video went viral and it was shared thousands of times. In the video footage, Vann also tells the boy: \"Tell me no. When I tell you to do something, you do it, boy.\" After the Burleson County Sheriff's Office launched an investigation, a \"behavior specialist\" who acted in an inappropriate manner with a young student was fired. The school district should provide a safe and secure environment for the students. And the school should not condone or tolerate the employees who abuse any child. The teachers who use excessive force against any child should be removed immediately from the classroom and placed on administrative leave. Otherwise, this will continue to happen. ",

The man was arrested right in the Capitol and charged with felony burglary and criminal mischief. It is not clear for now if his actions were inspired by the hatred towards Confederate symbols or namely towards Governor Stockdale. Nevertheless, this incident perfectly illustrates how liberal propaganda influences even on Southern people. The names of dignified Southern politicians and warriors should not be blurred out by Washington. These people played a huge role in American history; they fought for their beliefs and earned people's respect. It is absolutely unpatriotic now to demonize their names! We should protect our history and fight against liberal brainwashing. ",

    "ad_copy": "HILLARY CLINTON CHEATS AMERICAN VETERANSThe last time Hillary Clinton had a press conference on veterans' issues was in 2015 and since then all her plans and offers concerning veterans' life improvement were stated only in emails made by her staff. And here are some real Clinton decisions: —Last year, Clinton claimed that the Veterans Administration Scandal had been exaggerated by Republicans. —In 2007, Clinton was one of only 14 senators to vote against a 2007 supplemental appropriations bill that contained $1.8 billion for veterans' medical care. -In 2006, Clinton voted against an amendment that would have added $20 million for veterans' health care facilities. -In 2003, Clinton voted against a budget resolution that called for 113 billion for veterans to receive concurrent disability and retirement benefits.\" In other words, Hillary Clinton is one of the politicians who are to blame for the poor social condition of our veterans. She has systematically ignored the issue and even voted against providing veterans with financial aid which they need so bad! Hardly will she change her mind on the issue if she is elected. Clinton poses a direct threat to the American veterans' society, but still practically no one raises these concerns. Think twice before voting for her! ",

They started to monitor the behavior of police officers and challenge police brutality in Oakland, California. And they succeeded. Unfortunately, the government and especially Federal Bureau of Investigation called the party \"the greatest threat to the internal security of the country\". They tried to close it, to incarcerate BPP's participants, and in 1982 the original party was dissolved. 50 years have passed since BBP's foundation, but the situation in the country stills the same. Cops are shooting Blacks. It spreads through all the country like the disease. Nowadays we need Black Panthers as never before. We need a strong hand that can protect us, that can keep our people safe, that can make Black Lives really matter. Let's get together and celebrate the 50th anniversary of the party that has made the change. Let's honor its founders and participants. Let's share their ideas and ideals!

However, most of these athletes paid the price for this demonstration. For instance, on September 10, after getting permission from league officials, the staff and the students of the Beaumont Bulls football team took a knee before their game. On the next day, the students and the staff received death threats. Moreover, the executive board decided to suspend Coach RahORah Barber for the rest of the season and canceled the whole football season. So now we know what opposition might face in this country. ",

    "ad_copy": "Joshua was born in Chicago, Illinois, and raised in Indianapolis. Two monthsbefore his death, he proposed to his longtime girlfriend and the mother of two sons. Joshua Beal had come to Chicago to serve as a pallbearer in the funeral of his cousin Marcus Washington who was fatally shot on October 27, 2016 in Indianapolis at the age of 26. Beal was fatally shot after he and several relatives were involved in what authorities called a road rage incident with an off-duty police officer and an offduty firefighter. The relatives along with others in the caravan were headed to Southwest Memorial Chapel after burying their cousin Marcus Washington, she said. Suddenly, Boxley said, a car cut her off and then tried to run her 17-year-old sister off the road. She said her family as well as the motorist who had cut her off — who she believed was a Chicago police officer — stopped and got out of their cars. At some point the man pushed her female cousin to the ground and pulled a gun on her, pointing it at her face, according to Boxley. She said the man got inside his car but exited again and \"he just started shooting,\" hitting the windshield of a car containing Beal, who had pulled his gun when he saw the man holding a gun on their cousin. Boxley said Beal legally owned the gun and did not fire it. Boxley said the man pulled Beal out of his front passenger seat and began shooting him. \"I was hoping my brother wasn't dead,\" said Boxley. Beal's mother said he was a father to two children, a 4-year-old and a 2-yearold, and that his fiancee was a stay-at-home mother. \"This is what CPD do. They tear our families apart over and over again. They have no consideration for life,\" - Tiffaney Boxley. Yet another father of two has been shot, and despite what the cop's report will say, i know there can never be a way a Black man isn't guilty for his own death, armed or unarmed. #joshuabeal #altonsterling #TerenceCrutcher #westandtogether #blacklivesmatter #unite4justice ",

According to a witness, the man who was arrested had originally been driving across the light rail tracks, when officers on foot attempted to stop his car, at which point, he drove off. He added that the man \"wasn't resisting at all until they tased him\" After tasing the man police officers used their elbows and fists, as the man lay on the ground, screaming for help. The man was heard screaming in pain: \"My fucking back is killing me! Oh god! My back!\" In a statement, released on November 2, Minneapolis Police Department confirmed the arrest, but said that a fuller video would show that the officers' conduct was justified. ",

According to ex-cop's attorneys, their defendant acted in selfdefense despite the fact that Scott was unarmed and Slager fired eight times, hitting Scott five times from behind. Slager's defense attorney's: \"The double-teaming of Slager ... is a chilling example of how far politically motivated politicians and prosecutors will go to seek headlines and feather their own nests at the expense of a public servant ... who had to make a splitsecond life or death decision that will be second-guessed by comfortable armchair quarterbacks. This is unconscionable.' The shooting occurred in April 2015 when Slager stopped Scott for a broken brake light on the Mercedes-Benz he was driving. According to Slager's dashcam, ex-cop asked Scott to show his driving license and questioned him about documents for the car. When Slager returned to his car, Walter Scott jumped out of the car and ran away giving Slager chase. According to a bystander's video, Scott ran away from the officer when Slager opened fire. We've seen what happened in different parts of America: unarmed dead black bodies lying across the streets at the hands of police officers and none of them found guilty. That's why today it's important to send a message to other police officers that if they do this, it's harsh penalty to pay. ",

Police arrived at the scene after a series of 911 calls in which they were warned of a reckless driver and her erratic behavior. When cop saw Shirley, who was off her bipolar medication, they boxed her in with their patrol cars. When she started approaching them, law enforcement officers opened fire at her. The incident resulted in a fatal shooting. After the shooting, Shirley was taken to County Harbor-UCLA Medical Center and was pronounced dead. Michelle Shirley, 39, who received a diagnosis of a mental disorder tried to balance motherhood and law school. In a video titled, \"It's Up to Us,\" she was asking people to take seriously a mental disorder and seek help because ignoring it can take away years of people's lives. Did you know that people with mental illness are 16 times more likely to be killed during a police encounter than mental healthy? Did you know that half of people shot by cops are mentally ill? Police officers are not equipped with firearms to deal with mental illness in the field. But they are equipped to protect us from criminals. ",

The study showed that Caucasians earning less than $25,000 per year were likely to have better credit scores than African-Americans earning between $65,000 and $75,000 per year. Overall, the study found 27 percent of all credit reports belonging to Caucasians were poor, compared to 48 percent of those belonging to AfricanAmericans. Although credit reporting is supposed to be free of prejudice, some researchers said the system may be inherently stacked against minorities.

Manville continued to study while incarcerated and eventually earned two college degrees during his sentence. He became enamored with the legal profession and went to law school right after his parole. He finally passed the bar exams in Michigan and Washington, DC after waiting many years to be approved by the respective boards. Afterwards, Manville worked tirelessly to improve the prison system and represented various inmates and prison guards in civil cases. Nowadays, Manville teaches law at Michigan State University, where he hopes the insights he shares with students inspire them to someday help improve the system as well. —ListVerse-r ",

As a teenager, Henderson manufactured and sold drugs in his native home in Los Angeles. By 19, he was already earning US $35,000 per week. Henderson was later apprehended and imprisoned for 10 years after one of his men was caught carrying a big shipment. It was in prison that he discovered his natural flair for cooking, while he was on kitchen duty. He was released early for good behavior and soon started working for some of LA's top restaurants before venturing into Las Vegas. After experiencing many rejections due to his felonious past, Henderson finally managed to land a job at Caesar's Palace. It was only a matter of time before he finally started getting recognition and awards, including best Las Vegas Chef in 2001. All the fame and success hasn't gotten to Henderson's head though and he has continued to share his experiences with at-risk youth to show what they can achieve in life with the right choices. ",

Often times, we overlook our own businesses to purchase products and services from businesses outside of our communities. Many of us have heard the disturbing statistic about a dollar circulating within the black community for only 6 hours compared to approximately 2-4 weeks in white, Jewish, and Asian communities. If we don't support our entrepreneurs, how can we expect others to support our amazing businesses? We must continue to educate and change the mindset of consumers so \"buying black\" becomes the norm amongst our people and not only an encouragement during the holiday season,\" said Lonzell Fogle and Breyon Williams, founders of My Suited Life.

Joseph, a retired Pittsburgh firefighter, is moving an old house on Woolfe Street that's being displaced by development says he's doing it to make a statement. \"It was something that I really wanted to go into because it was something that's not done here by black folk. said Joseph Wicks; who now owns the house at 33 Woolfe St. `None of the historic revitalization is ever targeted toward black folk.\" Wicks says he has seen Blacks moved out of downtown neighborhoods because the development of the tourism in this area caused the increasing of home prices and made taxes unaffordable for most. The reason why Wicks bought this house is that it was built in 1840 and it cant be torn down! I'm so proud of this man! He is making a real movement! Actions like this can protect our history! ",

But after all, Kaepernick is a great athlete who not just sat out the national anthem in protest, but also gave back to the community by donating to the Black Youth Project 100. Kaepernick donated to the Chicago chapter of the organization toward \"Chapter-specific ideas and endeavors centered on advancing Agenda to Build Black Futures\" which is dedicated to creating justice and freedom for all Black people in order to improve the lives of black people in the United States of America. \"I'll continue to look at other communities in Chicago, as well, as far as what are ways I can help and what are ways I can try to help empower those communities,\" he said. When someone strives to uplift the negativity surrounding black people, there is always someone who will distort the positivity. But we don't really care about haters. Good job, Colin. ",

We've been watching our militarycommandership wasting lives of American soldiers for too long, let's hope it will end now when Trump is in charge. A new Marine Corps artillery unit was sent to assist Syrian opposition in Raqqa, according to Army Maj. Josh T. Jacques, a spokesman for U.S. Central Command. The artillery unit recently replaced about 400 Marines from the 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit, which provided artillery support to Kurdish and Syrian Arab forces expected to launch an offensive against Raqqa. We must deal with ISIS and end the terrorist threat once and for all. Unfortunately that's hardly possible because of the corruption in the Government. The Swamp in DC is still not drained from people like Senator McCain, and that's why our troops not only focus on defeating terrorism, but also getting involved into another regime change venture and possibly another oil war. We're fighting radical Islamists, but we're also siding with Syrian opposition, the very same radical Islamists, and there's absolutely no guarantee that these rebels won't replace ISIS when it's gone. There's only one chance to avoid another Iraq: Trump and the American nation must defeat globalist politicians and the Establishment. All we can do now is to pray for all American soldiers to return back home alive and safe. ",

Unfortunately, many of these hypocrites have infiltrated the American establishment. Such people benefit from regional conflicts and war is nothing more than business for them. It was these people who launched the missiles that never hit no terrorists but led to civilian casualties. It is them who keep receiving money from the same actors who sponsor ISIS and other groups. These people want more American involvement because it means more money for them and they don't care about the terrorists. In fact, radicals really help them increase their bloody income. The only way to resist the corrupt elites is to oppose military actions with no particular aim and promote anti-terrorist agenda! Focus on what's truly important and we will end the war in Syria sooner than you can imagine. ",

These videos and instances have become so common that people are rarely shocked by even the most brutal of cases. We were wondering how long time would it take to make people fighting back? So now, karma's coming back for blue pigs! A shocking video was shared on social media Tuesday showing two police officers being attacked. Two unidentified men were seen beating up the two officers for seemingly no reason. The incident occurred Monday afternoon in Northeast Philadelphia after two school police officers were called to break up a fight outside of a local pizza shop. As we can see police couldn't stop the fight. Now we see what kind of police do we have. Those cops are slow weak doughnuts, who can do literally nothing without using their guns. Cops can blame themselves when shit like this happens. They live by their own laws, they can break your arms and legs, torture you with chemical and electrical ways, rape or even kill you \"doing their job.\" All those things and more are well within departmental policy. So I'd rather give a fight for my rights than ignore the fact our country becoming a Nazi States of America. Look around, the only other thing that will happen is that people will whine about it, but will ultimately do nothing to actively stop this behavior, and this is why cops are so violent now. If we want to stop it, we should fight as our ancestors did it for centuries. Take out a few dozen cops and the rest will change. Amen. ",

In yet another disturbing video of police escalating violence in a public school, a Philadelphia school cop was caught on video in an intense altercation with a student. According to the Philadelphia Student Union, of which the alleged victim, Brian Burney, the incident was all over a dispute over using the bathroom. The student, who recorded the incident, was told to delete it. All that is left is a brief clip showing the officer, who is twice the size of Burney, on top of him. I don't understand why are there cops in schools? Cops are nothing more then a bunch of bullies or gang members in police uniforms! Whatever happened to deans? Moreover, don't you think it's a bit strange, when an officer forces someone to delete video? Obviously, police is trying to hide something and their testimony should be considered a lie. Also, is not destruction of evidence a crime? What do you think about it guys? Please, share or comment below. ",

He said that sending troops to Syria was a very difficult decision, but not bombing Syria was even harder to make. Obama was hated for not taking actions, but it's better for being hated for not killing innocent people that for starting a useless war. Though it was tough, Obama did a great job keeping away from the war that would take millions from the US budget and get innocent people killed. Unfortunately, the recent government didn't think twice, before they started bombing Syria. They will cut the support of Black families in the US to kill innocent kids in Syria. How did we come to this?! ",

    "ad_copy": "The US-led coalition strike in Syria's Raqqa province killed 12 women, theSyrian Observatory for Human Rights said this morning. The second coalition strike on a town near the Iraqi border killed 23 more civilians. Just to make it clear: our government is proposing spending cuts to most government agencies to pay for large increases in military, and everything we got from this is more and more civilians deaths. EPA, State and other development programs, Agriculture, Labor, Justice, Health and Human Services, Education, and many other domestic agencies faced more than 20% cuts in their budgets, and only the Department of Defense has grown by 10%. However, terrorists weren't destroyed in '30 days' and it seems like they won't be destroyed in the closest perspective. I mentioned before, and I will do it again: this is not a war against terrorism or a war 'for freedom', it's another example of money conflict, filling politician's pockets with blood money is the main goal of it.

On April 16 Plummer, his mother, and his 14-year-old little brother did not see the police lights because the unit was parked down the road. Plummer called 911 to report the burglars and then grabbed his Grandfather's shotgun that was given to his mother for protection. When Plummer went to the door, the scared kid fired a warning shot to fend off the would-be burglars. However, the shotgun blast hit one officer in the arm and the other in the face.

Here's what Ron Paul thinks about it: \"By the end of this month, Defense Secretary James Mattis and National Security Advisor HR McMaster will deliver to President Trump their plans for military escalations in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. President Trump would be wise to rip the plans up and send his national security team back to the drawing board — or replace them. There is no way another \"surge\" in Afghanistan and Iraq (plus a new one in Syria) puts America first. There is no way doing the same thing over again will succeed any better than it did the last time.\" Syria will be just another oil war; Iraq cost our country 4,500 soldier lives, and why the hell are we still in Afghanistan? We've started the whole Afghanistan thing to beat the Soviets, and no there's no Soviet Union on the world map, and all the communists left on this planet are only Chinese and Californian students.

Our military presence in Syria now doesn't serve American interests. Our soldiers are there to fight and die for Globalists, Saudis and Israelis, but not for Americans. And that's why we keep on talking about it: this policy is directly opposite to the \"America First\" concept. I believe Trump can fix it, just like he promised. Sadly days after days and weeks after weeks of Trump's presidency there are no changes in that direction. Israel captured a Syrian region named Golan Heights in 1967, and today this land is internationally considered to be occupied territory. Israelis want to use Trump's influence so the world would acknowledge Israeli sovereignty. Trump is a dealer, and maybe he's trying make a deal out of it, but there's one important thing here: under no circumstances can our soldiers' lives be put at risk for that. So many times during the presidential campaign Trump said \"let's bring back our soldiers home\", and now it's really time to do it. This is not our war. ",

    "ad_copy": "New administration's budget proposal to Congress includes $1.7 trillion inmandatory spending cuts over 10 years, including $800 billion from Medicaid and $193 billion from food stamps. At the same time, this proposal, called \"A New Foundation for American Greatness\", includes a boost in military spending and $1.6 billion for the construction of the border wall with Mexico. To be honest, I'm not sure, that the wall and another pointless war, instead of affordable health care and help for those in need, is what we have to keep our focus on. It seems like republicans are using every single possibility to get more money for their wars, and they don't mind it if average Americans live in poverty or without affordable medicine. Why additional billions to Military? Our Department of Defense budget is already bigger than military budgets of the next eight countries combined, isn't it enough? Here is what Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said: \"Based on what we know about this budget, the good news -- the only good news -- is that it's likely to be roundly rejected by members of both parties here in the Senate — just as the last budget was\" ",

    "ad_copy": "The administration is requesting a $54 billion increase in military spending for2018. Not a small sum, it's roughly equal to the entire annual military budget of France, larger than the defense budgets of the United Kingdom, Germany, and Japan, and only $12 billion less than the entire Russian military budget of 2015. But what about domestic and State Department spending? For example, such an increase for the Department of Defense means 31% cut in the EPA's budget and a 29% cut in the State Department. In other words, it's a great number of opportunities squandered in favor of the interests of highpowerful warmongers in our government. Environment, diplomacy, alternative energy, housing or infrastructure repair? Not today. Today they want thousands of peaceful people to die for their money interests. And they use every opportunity to start another war, they are acting the same way in Syria. Start thinking! ",
